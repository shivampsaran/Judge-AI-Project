The defense's argument hinges on the necessity of ""specific direction"" for aiding and abetting liability, a requirement which has been explicitly rejected by the Appeals Chamber in the Šainović decision. Horvat provided substantial logistical and personnel assistance to the HVO with full knowledge of their criminal activities. His actions had a direct and significant effect on the commission of atrocities in Mostar and Ahmići. The evidence demonstrates that Horvat was aware of the grave crimes being committed and continued to facilitate them, which satisfies the required mens rea and actus reus for aiding and abetting.

In Horvat's case, while he provided substantial logistical and personnel support to the HVO, these actions were not specifically directed at the commission of the war crimes in Mostar and Ahmići.

The prosecution contends that specific direction is not a necessary element and that Horvat’s logistical support, provided with knowledge of the HVO’s criminal activities, suffices for liability. Reviewing the precedent and statutory provisions, it's evident that the specific direction requirement is crucial for distinguishing between general logistical support and direct facilitation of specific crimes. Given that the Appeals Chamber’s Vasiljević decision requires specific direction, and considering the remote nature of Horvat's involvement, it cannot be conclusively established that his assistance was specifically directed towards the commission of the crimes.
