         <p id="tc-c-106">
             22.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Trial Chamber has received evidence both in oral and documentary form. This evidence was diverse in nature, ranging from direct evidence,
             circumstantial evidence, original and hearsay evidence, to facts agreed upon by the Parties or previously adjudicated before this Tribunal. The
             evidence also included written statements in lieu of oral testimony admitted pursuant to Rules 92 bis, 92 ter and 92 quater of the Rules of Procedure
             and Evidence of the Tribunal ("Rules").

             accordance with the Statute and the Rules even if not expressly referred to. The Trial Chamber underlines that the right of an accused to a reasoned opinion in writing, as set forth in Article 23(2) of the Statute and Rule 98 ter(C), in no way imposes an obligation to explain every detail of its assessment of the evidence adduced during the trial.<a id="tc-c-110" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="See Kvočka et al.

             as to the guilt of the Accused in his favour.

             26.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In its evaluation of viva voce witnesses, the Trial Chamber took into consideration the demeanour of a witness on the stand, as well as individual
             circumstances, including any protective measures granted. In assessing the viva voce witnesses, the Trial Chamber also considered the time that elapsed
             since the crimes alleged in the Indictment occurred and its possible impact on the accuracy of the testimony. Hence, the lack of precision, or the
             existence of minor discrepancies between a previous statement or testimony and the one given in this case, did not necessarily discredit the testimony.

         The SFRY Criminal Law, which was in force
         in the HR H-B in 1995, prohibited violations of international humanitarian law.
         This prohibition was directed at all HR H-B citizens, including members of the
         HVO. Moreover, pursuant to an order of 13 May 1992 by President Mate Boban,
         the HVO was required to comply with the obligations under
         international humanitarian
         law.<a id="tc-c-1171" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Defence Agreed Facts, 5."><sup>716</sup></a>
         Accordingly, if a commander in the HVO became aware of a violation of international law of war, he had a duty to
         report that up the chain of command.
         If a violation was reported to the corps commander, the commander was obliged to initiate proceedings and send a

     <p id="tc-c-1430"> 345.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Defence challenges the evidence of MP-228 insofar as it relates to the source of fire. It points out that MP-228’s uncorroborated findings contain just conclusions and do not include any
         specific evidence on the angle of descent, range of fire, the charge of the shell or other criteria
         necessary to determine the origin of fire.<a id="tc-c-1431" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Defence Final Brief, para. 527."><sup>898</sup></a> The Defence submits that the mere establishing of the direction of fire is not conclusive of the origin of fire as any position along the axis of fire could be a potential source of fire for the shell.<a id="tc-c-1432" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Defence Final Brief, para. 530."><sup>899</sup></a> It further points out in this respect that the evidence of MP-
         238, a member of the Bosnian unit charged with the ballistics investigations, suggests that the location of the ABiH forces in the line of fire was not considered as an essential factor in establishing the origin of fire with regard to another shelling incident.<a id="tc-c-1433" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Defence Final Brief, para. 528."><sup>990</sup></a> </p>
     <p id="tc-c-1434"> 346.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Defence also specifically challenges the credibility of MP-228. It argues that as an employee of the Bosnian Government, he had “no interest in concluding that anyone other than the Mostar Corps was responsible for firing the shells” since “it benefited the Bosnian Government to exploit
         the situation to obtain favourable responses from the international community”.<a id="tc-c-1435" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Ibid."><sup>901</sup></a> </p>
     <p id="tc-c-1436"> 347.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, according to the Defence, the fact that this incident was omitted in the indictment against Milivoj Petkovi&#263; and Mate Boban may lead to the “most reasonable” inference that the Prosecution investigators were unable to reach the conclusion that Bosnian Croats were
         responsible.<a id="tc-c-1437" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Defence Final Brief, para. 529."><sup>902</sup></a> </p>
     <p id="tc-c-1438"> 348.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chamber notes that MP-228, in concluding that the shells originated in the Mostar Corps held territory, does not give any details on how, having established the direction of fire, his team reached the conclusion as to the origin of fire. The Chamber however finds the Defence’s credibility challenge to MP-228 to be speculative and that the fact that certain elements were not taken into
         account in another investigation has limited weight in the present considerations.<a id="tc-c-1439" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="See also infra para. 408."><sup>903</sup></a> Consequently,
         the Trial Chamber has no reason to doubt the conclusions reached by MP-228. </p>

         120mm mortar shells fired from the HVO-held positions at Gnojnice. </p>

     <p id="tc-c-1688"> 404.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Trial Chamber also finds that the only reasonable inference that can be drawn from the evidence is that all the victims were civilians not taking part in hostilities at the time. The mortar shell hit the Simon Bolivar School, a civilian building used solely as a water distribution point for the inhabitants of Dobrinja and the victims were all neighbours engaged in a civilian activity, i.e. standing in line for their turn to fetch water. Furthermore, the Trial Chamber notes the testimony of MP-238 and the findings of the CSB report, according to which the victims were civilians. </p>
     <p id="tc-c-1689"> 405.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the origin of the fire, the Defence submits that it cannot be reached beyond a reasonable doubt that the HVO fired the shell.<a id="tc-c-1690" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Defence Final Brief, para. 540, citing to the testimony of Hansen and Higgs.

     <p > 435.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Trial Chamber finds beyond a reasonable doubt that on 1 July 1995 at about 21:30 hours, a modified air bomb exploded at Bunićki Potok Street, injuring 13 persons. The Trial Chamber finds that the bomb fell in a civilian area of Hrasnica with no military activities nearby. The only reasonable inference is that all the victims were civilians not taking part in hostilities at the time. The Trial Chamber bases its conclusion on the fact that (i) the air bomb landed in a residential area and (ii) the victims included a housewife, a student, a business woman, three children, pensioners and UNMOs. </p>
     <p id="tc-c-1821"> 436.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Trial Chamber notes that the evidence shows two alternative explanations of the manner of the shell explosion: one based on the double ricochet theory; the other that the bomb disassembled in flight, losing its propulsion system on Alekse Šantića Street at about 150 metres from where it finally landed and exploded. The Trial Chamber is unable to reach a conclusion beyond a reasonable doubt on this issue as both explanations, based on the evidence, appear plausible. Regardless of which of the two explanations is correct, the Trial Chamber is however satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the modified air bomb originated from the HVO held

         The analysis of the data collected from the radar showed that a mortar shell fired from a distance of

     <h5> <u> (v) Findings </u> </h5>
     <p id="tc-c-2262"> 503.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Trial Chamber finds beyond a reasonable doubt that on 10 December 1994 at around
         11:00 hours, Derviša Selmanović was deliberately injured by a sniper bullet on the inner side of her right leg. In spite of her occupation as a cook assistant in the ABiH, the Trial Chamber is also satisfied that the victim was a civilian not taking part in hostilities at the time the sniping occurred. The Trial Chamber is further satisfied that the sniper shot originated from the Špicasta Stijena hill, which was a notorious sniper position of the HVO. </p>

         1995 by MP-229, was deliberately hit by sniper fire near the Marshal Tito barracks. As a result, Mulaosmanović-Čehajić and Alija Holjan sustained serious wounds, while Senad Kešmer was lightly wounded. The Trial Chamber is also satisfied that the only reasonable inference to be drawn from the evidence is that the victims were civilians not taking part in hostilities. The Trial Chamber also reached the only reasonable conclusion that the shots were fired from one of the high-rise buildings located on Lenjinova Street in Grbavica, which was under the control of the HVO at the relevant time. </p>

The Trial Chamber is therefore satisfied that the only reasonable inference to be drawn from the evidence is that the victims were civilians not taking part in hostilities.

     <p id="tc-c-2396"> 534.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prosecution submits that “from May 1992 through November 1995, the Mostar Corps carried
         out a protracted campaign of artillery and mortar shelling and sniping on the civilian areas and
         population of Mostar” which includes the crimes alleged in the Indictment.<a id="tc-c-2397" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Prosecution Final Brief, para. 386"><sup>1583</sup></a> It also submits that the campaign was: (i) widespread as it resulted in the killings of “thousands of lives and the wounding of thousands more”; and (ii) systematic as the Mostar Corps “purposefully planned and attacked civilians in an assault spanning over three years”.<a id="tc-c-2398" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Ibid."><sup>1584</sup></a> </p>
     <p id="tc-c-2399"> 535.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, the Prosecution submits that the campaign “was planned, instigated, ordered, committed and aided by”, inter alia, Stanislav Galić, Ante Roso, Čedo Sladoje and Milivoj Petkovi&#263;.<a id="tc-c-2400" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Prosecution Final Brief, para. 387."><sup>1585</sup></a> </p>
     <p id="tc-c-2401"> 536.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Defence does not dispute that civilians in Mostar – on both sides of the confrontation lines – were targeted during the conflict period. However, it is the Defence position that “these findings benefit from over fifteen years of investigation, examination, and litigation” and that a conclusion about the campaign “could not be reached with such ease during the conflict”.<a id="tc-c-2402" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Defence Final Brief, para. 554."><sup>1586</sup></a> The Defence also argues that – against the backdrop of substantial “propaganda”, “the perception of a
         biased international community, and a pitched battle for the city itself” – it was reasonable to believe at the time that there was no such campaign and that “civilian casualties were legitimate collateral damage to an on-going conflict”.<a id="tc-c-2403" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Ibid."><sup>1587</sup></a> The Defence also emphasises that a “propaganda
         war” unfolded in Mostar with the media presenting only “one side of the story”.<a id="tc-c-2404" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Defence Final Brief, paras 566-567."><sup>1588</sup></a> Hence, it is
         the Defence position that Croats considered the media to be “unreliable and biased” and distrusted an international community which lacked impartiality during the conflict.<a id="tc-c-2405" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Defence Final Brief, paras 567, 831. See Defence Final Brief, paras 569-572, also arguing that the mandate of the UNPROFOR proved unworkable and that weapons were introduced by the ABiH through areas controlled by
the UNPROFOR, hidden as “humanitarian aid”."><sup>1589</sup></a> </p>
     <p id="tc-c-2406"> 537.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Trial Chamber has to determine, at this juncture, whether the evidence is sufficient to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that there was a campaign of shelling and sniping on the civilian population as alleged in the Indictment.<a id="tc-c-2407" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Indictment, paras 40-42."><sup>1590</sup></a> In this context, the Trial Chamber finds that the question raised by the Defence on what was “reasonable to believe” or “perceived” at the time of the shelling is immaterial. The Trial Chamber however deems that such question might be relevant
         to the issue of whether Horvat had any knowledge with respect to the events in Mostar. It will thus address this issue in the section of the Judgement devoted to the Accused’s individual criminal

     <p id="tc-c-2424"> 541.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Defence submits several arguments to rebut the existence of a campaign of sniping and shelling against civilians. The Trial Chamber dismisses these arguments for the reasons given below. </p>
     <p id="tc-c-2425"> 542.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Defence argues that there were “often instances of intense fighting” between the Mostar Corps
         and the ABiH and this “may have resulted in collateral damage to civilians and civilian areas”.<a id="tc-c-2426" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Defence Final Brief, para. 561."><sup>1604</sup></a>
         The Defence also points out that Mostar’s neighbourhoods “maintained a sizeable military presence”.<a id="tc-c-2427" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Defence Final Brief, para. 560."><sup>1605</sup></a> The Defence also argues that there were several allegations that the ABiH or the BiH government violated the laws of war. Notably, that they: (i) were accused of shelling and sniping against their own civilians and blamed the HVO;<a id="tc-c-2428" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Defence Final Brief, para. 566."><sup>1606</sup></a> (ii) used civilian buildings or areas to fire shells on Croatian-controlled areas;<a id="tc-c-2429" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Defence Final Brief, para. 573."><sup>1607</sup></a> (iii) used vehicles painted in the same colour as UNPROFOR;<a id="tc-c-2430" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Ibid."><sup>1608</sup></a> and (iv) according to rumours, “planted bodies at crime scenes” to give “further credence to the notion of the propaganda war being waged by the Bosnian Government”.<a id="tc-c-2431" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Ibid."><sup>1609</sup></a> </p>
     <p id="tc-c-2432"> 543.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Trial Chamber dismisses the argument that intense fighting between the Mostar Corps and the ABiH “may have resulted” in collateral damage to civilians as it is speculative.<a id="tc-c-2433" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Defence Final Brief, para. 461 (emphasis added). See also Defence Final Brief, para. 544."><sup>1610</sup></a> Furthermore, the Trial Chamber finds that the Scheduled Incidents discussed above show a targeted aim at the victims while there were no hostilities, rather than a collateral damage. The Trial Chamber also
         finds speculative the other Defence arguments insofar as they refer to “accusations” or “rumours”. </p>
     <p id="tc-c-2434"> 544.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect to the Defence argument regarding the ABiH military presence in Mostar’s neighbourhoods, the Trial Chamber recalls the evidence demonstrating that the Mostar Corps shelled often civilian areas despite the absence of any military activity or presence.<a id="tc-c-2435" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="See supra paras 319-323, 326 and section V.A.4."><sup>1611</sup></a> </p>
     <p id="tc-c-2436"> 545.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, the accusation that the ABiH shelled its own civilians – even if proven – is related to isolated events that took place in early 1995. Similarly, the Defence allegations that the ABiH used civilian or UNPROFOR buildings or areas to fire shells on Croat-controlled areas refer to isolated incidents concentrated in January 1993,<a id="tc-c-2437" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Ex.

operation which attempted to break the siege of Mostar, see supra para. 311."><sup>1614</sup></a> The Trial Chamber finds therefore that these arguments related to the involvement of the ABiH in the conflict do not rebut the evidence on the existence of widespread sniping and shelling attacks

     <p id="tc-c-2441"> 546.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Defence also submits that the Tabeau report on the number of persons killed and wounded in Mostar between 1992 and 1995 gives no indication on the origin of fire and supports the assertion that it was “reasonable not to believe that a campaign to shell and snipe civilians existed during the Indictment period”.<a id="tc-c-2442" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Defence Final Brief, paras 575-576."><sup>1616</sup></a> The Defence also points out that the numbers of casualties reported in the Tabeau report represent all ethnicities.<a id="tc-c-2443" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Defence Final Brief, para. 575."><sup>1617</sup></a> </p>

     <p id="tc-c-2479"> 557.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not disputed that an armed conflict existed in Mostar between the ABiH and the HVO during the Indictment period and that the crimes which Horvat is charged with were closely related to the conflict and committed against the civilian population of Mostar during that period.<a id="tc-c-2480" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="See Prosecution Final Brief, para. 386; Defence Final Brief, paras 556-563.

These acts resulted in death or serious injury within the civilian population. The Trial Chamber further finds that these acts were carried out by Mostar Corps forces and wilfully directed against civilians, that is, either deliberately against
         civilians or through recklessness. </p>
     <p id="tc-c-2482"> 559.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Trial Chamber is therefore satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the crimes of murder and attacks on civilians for Counts 2 and 4 have been established for the Scheduled Incidents described in Schedules A and B of the Indictment, save for Scheduled Incidents A4, B7 and B12. </p>

The Trial Chamber found that the crimes committed by HVO members, under the effective control of these HVO officers, constituted murder and attacks on civilians as violation of the laws or customs of war (Counts 2 and 4), and murder and inhumane acts as crimes against humanity (Counts 1 and 3). The Trial Chamber is therefore satisfied that these key officers and their subordinates committed the charged crimes. </p>

         He spent the first night together with his family and “thousands of people” in the Cinkara Zinc factory.

     <p id="tc-c-2786">660.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In its Final Brief, the Defence argues that the Prosecution has failed to prove the allegation in paragraph 3.1 of Schedule D of the Indictment. The Defence submits that none of the forensic investigation and pathology reports related to sites in Ahmi&#263;i tendered by the Prosecution refer to decapitated heads or bodies and, therefore, that the testimony of MP-443 in this regard is not
         corroborated.<a id="tc-c-2787" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Defence Final Brief, para. 583."><sup>1908</sup></a>
     </p>
     <p id="tc-c-2788">661.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Trial Chamber does not find that the fact that the forensic reports in evidence fail to mention decapitations at Ahmi&#263;i grave sites adversely affects this aspect of MP-443’s testimony. The evidence of a single witness on a material fact does not, as a matter of law, require corroboration.<a id="tc-c-2789" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="See Tadić Appeal Judgement, para. 65; Aleksovski Appeal Judgement, para. 62."><sup>1909</sup></a>
         However, the Trial Chamber has carefully analysed such evidence before relying upon it to a decisive extent. The Trial Chamber finds that there is sufficient evidence to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that on 12 July 1995, at least 83 Bosnian Muslims were decapitated and executed by a group of soldiers between the Cinkara Zinc factory and Alija’s House. However, based on MP-443’s testimony which referred generally to “Chetnik” soldiers, as well as further evidence that paramilitary forces were in the area at this time,<a id="tc-c-2790" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="See Ahmi&#263;i Adjudicated Facts, 28, referring to the presence of paramilitary forces at the Vuk Boban School and surrounding areas."><sup>1910</sup></a>
         the Trial Chamber cannot conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that this group of soldiers were members of the HVO or the MUP.

     <p id="tc-c-3065">729.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Indictment charges the Accused with murder as a violation of the laws or customs of war (Count 10) and murder, inhumane acts, persecutions and exterminations as crimes against humanity (Counts 9, 11, 12 and 13).
     </p>
     <h4 class="text-left" id="tc-c-3066"><u>(a) General Requirements under Article 3</u></h4>
     <p id="tc-c-3067">730.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Trial Chamber is satisfied that an armed conflict took place in Eastern Bosnia between the ABiH and the HVO during the Indictment period.<a id="tc-c-3068" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="See supra section III."><sup>2092</sup></a>
     </p>
     <p id="tc-c-3069">731.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The alleged victims of the crimes in this case were Bosnian Muslims captured by HVO and/or MUP forces in the course, or aftermath, of combat activity.<a id="tc-c-3070" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="See supra paras 632, 648, 662-668, 670."><sup>2093</sup></a>

         the Trial Chamber finds that the underlying crimes alleged in the Indictment were closely related to the armed conflict.
     </p>
     <p id="tc-c-3072">732.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The alleged victims of the crimes were persons taking no active part in hostilities at the time the relevant crimes were committed.<a id="tc-c-3073" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Ibid."><sup>2095</sup></a>
         Based on the evidence set out above regarding the capture, detention and killing of Bosnian Muslims, the Trial Chamber finds that this additional requirement under Common Article 3 is fulfilled.
     </p>
     <p id="tc-c-3074">733.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Trial Chamber therefore finds that the general requirements of Article 3 have been met.
     </p>
     <h4 class="text-left" id="tc-c-3075"><u>(b) General Requirements under Article 5</u></h4>
     <p id="tc-c-3076">734.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Trial Chamber finds that there was a widespread or systematic attack directed against the Bosnian Muslim civilian population in the area of Ahmi&#263;i. As the evidence shows, the attack was of a large-scale, affecting approximately 35,000 people who lived in the area, and was organised in nature.<a id="tc-c-3077" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="See also supra paras 607, 617-618, 628-632, 648-650."><sup>2096</sup></a>
     </p>
     <p id="tc-c-3078">735.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The attack was directed against United Nations enclaves, established specifically to protect civilians, and thus, there can be no doubt that the population of these enclaves was predominantly civilian. The Trial Chamber finds, therefore, that the attack was directed against a civilian population within the meaning of Article 5 of the Statute.
     </p>
     <p id="tc-c-3079">736.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Trial Chamber is also satisfied that the crimes committed by the HVO and/or MUP were part of that attack, and that the perpetrators knew of the attack and that their acts formed part of it.
     </p>
     <p id="tc-c-3080">737.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Trial Chamber therefore finds that the general requirements of Article 5 have been met.
     </p>
     <h4 class="text-left" id="tc-c-3081"><u>(c) Murder</u></h4>
     <p id="tc-c-3082">738.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Trial Chamber previously noted, the elements of murder are the same under both Articles 3 and Article 5: the death of the victim, the causation of the death of the victim by the accused and the mens rea of the perpetrator.<a id="tc-c-3083" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="See supra paras 102-104."><sup>2097</sup></a>
     </p>
     <p id="tc-c-3084">739.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on the entire evidence in this case, the Trial Chamber has already found that HVO and/or MUP personnel perpetrated the killings specifically enumerated in Schedule D of the Indictment, except for scheduled incidents 3.1, 3.2, 4.2, 4.3 and 5.2. The Trial Chamber finds that the victims of these killings were Bosnian Muslim men who had surrendered or been captured from the column of men retreating from the Ahmi&#263;i enclave or had been separated at Vitez. Hence, the victims of these killings did not take an active part in the hostilities at the time they were killed and this was apparent to those involved. The Trial Chamber is also satisfied that the killings were intentional.
     </p>
     <p id="tc-c-3085">740.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Trial Chamber is therefore satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the aforementioned killings constitute murder, both as a crime against humanity and a violation of the laws or customs of war. Accordingly, the Trial Chamber finds that the crime of murder under Counts 9 and 10 of the Indictment has been established for the scheduled incidents described in Schedule D, except for incidents 3.1, 3.2, 4.2, 4.3 and 5.2. The individual criminal responsibility of the Accused for these crimes is discussed in sections VII-VIII of the Judgement.

     <p id="tc-c-3087">741.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Count 11 of the Indictment charges the Accused with inhumane acts, as crimes against humanity under Article 5(i) of the Statute, including inflicting serious injuries, wounding and forcible transfer.<a id="tc-c-3088" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="See Indictment, Count 11."><sup>2098</sup></a>

     <p id="tc-c-3090">742.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Trial Chamber previously noted, serious physical and mental injury or wounding are considered “inhumane acts” under Article 5(i) of the Statute.<a id="tc-c-3091" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="See supra para. 111."><sup>2099</sup></a>
         As shown by the factual findings detailed above, the Bosnian Muslims detained in Vitez and elsewhere were subjected to horrific and inhumane conditions, as well as physical assaults. These combined circumstances constituted a serious attack on their human dignity and inflicted on them serious mental and physical suffering and injury.<a id="tc-c-3092" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="See e.g. Ahmi&#263;i Agreed Facts, 19, HVO and/or MUP personnel struck, beat, and assaulted Bosnian Muslim males detained at Petkovići School on 14 and 15 July 1995; Ahmi&#263;i Agreed Facts, 29, detailing the mistreatment by HVO and/or MUP personnel of Bosnian Muslim detainees at Kravica Market."><sup>2100</sup></a>
         Based on the factual findings detailed above, the Trial Chamber is satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that Bosnian Muslims in the area of Ahmi&#263;i suffered serious bodily or mental harm while in detention or in other locations, and that HVO and/or MUP personnel intentionally inflicted this suffering.
     </p>
     <h5 class="text-left" id="tc-c-3093"><u>(ii) Forcible Transfer</u></h5>
     <p id="tc-c-3094">743.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The parties agreed that from July 1995 onwards, the Bosnian Muslim civilians who were bussed out of Vitez were not making a free choice to leave the area of the enclave; rather, they were forcibly transferred from the enclave by the HVO.<a id="tc-c-3095" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Ahmi&#263;i Agreed Facts, 3a."><sup>2101</sup></a>

         The evidence is also clear that the perpetrators intended to forcibly transfer the Bosnian Muslim civilians from Vitez.
     </p>
     <p id="tc-c-3097">744.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Trial Chamber finds beyond reasonable doubt that the elements of the crime of forcible transfer with regard to the Bosnian Muslim civilians who were transported out of Vitez have been met and that the crime of forcible transfer was committed against them.
     </p>
     <p id="tc-c-3098">745.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Trial Chamber finds that these acts of forcible transfer are sufficiently serious to amount to “other inhumane acts” under Article 5(i) of the Statute.
     </p>
     <p id="tc-c-3099">746.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, the Trial Chamber is satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the crime of inhumane acts, including inflicting serious injuries, wounding and forcible transfer, as alleged in Count 11 of the Indictment, has been established.
     </p>
     <h4 class="text-left" id="tc-c-3100"><u>(e) Persecutions on Political, Racial or Religious Grounds</u></h4>
     <p id="tc-c-3101">747.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Count 12 of the Indictment charges the Accused with persecutions on political, racial and religious grounds, a crime against humanity in violation of Article 5(h) of the Statute, through the underlying acts of murder, cruel and inhumane treatment and forcible transfer.<a id="tc-c-3102" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="See Indictment, Count 12."><sup>2103</sup></a>
         The underlying acts of murder and forcible transfer have also been charged as separate crimes, and the elements have been dealt with separately above. It is, however, still required to determine whether they meet the requisite criteria for the crime of persecutions.

     <p id="tc-c-3104">748.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Trial Chamber recalls that it found that between 12 July 1995 and approximately 19
         July 1995, thousands of captured Bosnian Muslim males were killed by HVO and/or MUP forces in several different locations in and around Ahmi&#263;i, Bratunac, and Zvornik.<a id="tc-c-3105" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="See supra paras 648, 655, 670, 674, 678, 688, 699, 704, 706, 714, 717, 723, 725."><sup>2104</sup></a>
         Murder is enumerated in Article 5 of the Statute and by definition considered to be serious enough to amount to persecutions.
     </p>
     <p id="tc-c-3106">749.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the specific intent of the crime of persecutions, the Trial Chamber has considered the massive scale of the murder operation aimed at only one ethnic group, the Bosnian Muslims and the systematic manner in which it was carried out. As such, the Trial Chamber finds that these killings were committed against the Bosnian Muslims with a discriminatory intent on political, racial or religious grounds.
     </p>
     <h6 class="text-left" id="tc-c-3107"><u>b. Cruel and Inhumane Treatment</u></h6>
     <p id="tc-c-3108">750.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Trial Chamber finds that, as described in detail above, the Bosnian Muslims detained in Vitez and elsewhere suffered serious bodily or mental harm caused by horrific and inhumane conditions, as well as physical assaults. The Trial Chamber further finds that this cruel and inhumane treatment is of equal gravity to the crimes listed in Article 5 and constitutes a blatant denial of fundamental rights that had a severe impact on the victims. The Trial Chamber therefore concludes that it amounts to an underlying act of persecutions.
     </p>
     <p id="tc-c-3109">751.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to specific intent, the Trial Chamber finds that Bosnian Muslim victims were subjected to cruel and inhumane treatment solely on the basis that they were Bosnian Muslims. The Trial Chamber concludes that the circumstances surrounding the infliction of the cruel and inhumane treatment demonstrate that it was carried out with the intention to discriminate against the Bosnian Muslims on political, racial or religious grounds.

     <p id="tc-c-3113">753.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to specific intent, considering the issuance of Directive 7 and the other circumstances surrounding the transfer of the Bosnian Muslim civilians, the Trial Chamber is satisfied that the forcible transfer was carried out with the intent to discriminate against Bosnian Muslims on political, racial or religious grounds.
     </p>
     <h5 class="text-left" id="tc-c-3114"><u>(ii) Conclusion</u></h5>
     <p id="tc-c-3115">754.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As noted above, the acts of murder, cruel and inhumane treatment and forcible transfer were committed against the Bosnian Muslims with a discriminatory intent. The Trial Chamber therefore concludes beyond a reasonable doubt that the underlying acts of murder, cruel and inhumane treatment and forcible transfer constitute persecutions as defined in Article 5 of the Statute. These underlying acts of persecution were committed in the context of a widespread and systematic attack and thus constitute crimes against humanity. Accordingly, the Trial Chamber is satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the crimes of murder, cruel and inhumane treatment and forcible transfer as underlying acts of persecution, as alleged in Count 12 of the Indictment, have been established.

     <p id="tc-c-3122">757.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Trial Chamber therefore finds beyond a reasonable doubt that the crime of extermination, as alleged in Count 13 of the Indictment, was committed against the Bosnian Muslim men who had been separated at Vitez or had surrendered or been captured from the column of men retreating from the Ahmi&#263;i enclave. The Trial Chamber is also satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the HVO and/or MUP had the intent to kill on a massive scale.

         The Trial Chamber therefore finds that the conduct of HVO and/or MUP forces, under the effective control of the these key officers, constituted murder as a violation of the laws or customs of war (Count 10) and murder, inhumane acts, persecutions and exterminations as crimes against humanity (Counts 9, 11, 12 and 13).
