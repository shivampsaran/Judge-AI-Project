<p id="tc-s-2786">660.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In its Final Brief, the Defence argues that the Prosecution has failed to prove the allegation in paragraph 3.1 of Schedule D of the Indictment. The Defence submits that none of the forensic investigation and pathology reports related to sites in Vlasenica tendered by the Prosecution refer to decapitated heads or bodies and, therefore, that the testimony of MP-443 in this regard is not
corroborated.<a id="tc-s-2787" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Defence Final Brief, para. 583."><sup>1908</sup></a>

<p id="tc-s-2788">661.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Trial Chamber does not find that the fact that the forensic reports in evidence fail to mention decapitations at Vlasenica grave sites adversely affects this aspect of MP-443’s testimony.

However, the Trial Chamber has carefully analysed such evidence before relying upon it to a decisive extent. The Trial Chamber finds that there is sufficient evidence to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that on 12 July 1995, at least 83 Bosnian Muslims were decapitated and executed by a group of soldiers between the Cinkara Zinc factory and Alija’s House. However, based on MP-443’s testimony which referred generally to “Chetnik” soldiers, as well as further evidence that paramilitary forces were in the area at this time,<a id="tc-s-2790" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="See Vlasenica Adjudicated Facts, 28, referring to the presence of paramilitary forces at the Vuk Karad‘ić School and surrounding areas."><sup>1910</sup></a>

Taking a number of factors into account, the Trial Chamber found Deronjić’s evidence to be reliable, relevant and of probative value, Decision on Prosecution Motions for Admission of Evidence Pursuant to Rule 92 quater, 10 October 2008, (confidential) paras 47-53."><sup>1926</sup></a>
By the same token, the Trial Chamber has adopted a very prudent approach to the evidence of Momir Nikolić and Dragomir Vasić because of their involvement in the events in Vlasenica.

<p id="tc-s-3065">729.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Indictment charges the Accused with murder as a violation of the laws or customs of war (Count 10) and murder, inhumane acts, persecutions and exterminations as crimes against humanity (Counts 9, 11, 12 and 13).
</p>
<h4 class="text-left" id="tc-s-3066"><u>(a) General Requirements under Article 3</u></h4>
<p id="tc-s-3067">730.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Trial Chamber is satisfied that an armed conflict took place in Eastern Bosnia between the ABiH and the VRS during the Indictment period.<a id="tc-s-3068" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="See supra section III."><sup>2092</sup></a>

Based on the evidence set out above regarding the capture, detention and killing of Bosnian Muslims,<a id="tc-s-3071" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Ibid."><sup>2094</sup></a>
the Trial Chamber finds that the underlying crimes alleged in the Indictment were closely related to the armed conflict.
</p>
<p id="tc-s-3072">732.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The alleged victims of the crimes were persons taking no active part in hostilities at the time the relevant crimes were committed.<a id="tc-s-3073" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Ibid."><sup>2095</sup></a>
Based on the evidence set out above regarding the capture, detention and killing of Bosnian Muslims, the Trial Chamber finds that this additional requirement under Common Article 3 is fulfilled.
</p>
<p id="tc-s-3074">733.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Trial Chamber therefore finds that the general requirements of Article 3 have been met.
</p>
<h4 class="text-left" id="tc-s-3075"><u>(b) General Requirements under Article 5</u></h4>
<p id="tc-s-3076">734.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Trial Chamber finds that there was a widespread or systematic attack directed against the Bosnian Muslim civilian population in the area of Vlasenica. As the evidence shows, the attack was of a large-scale, affecting approximately 35,000 people who lived in the area, and was organised in nature.<a id="tc-s-3077" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="See also supra paras 607, 617-618, 628-632, 648-650."><sup>2096</sup></a>
</p>
<p id="tc-s-3078">735.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The attack was directed against United Nations enclaves, established specifically to protect civilians, and thus, there can be no doubt that the population of these enclaves was predominantly civilian. The Trial Chamber finds, therefore, that the attack was directed against a civilian population within the meaning of Article 5 of the Statute.
</p>
<p id="tc-s-3079">736.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Trial Chamber is also satisfied that the crimes committed by the VRS and/or MUP were part of that attack, and that the perpetrators knew of the attack and that their acts formed part of it.
</p>
<p id="tc-s-3080">737.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Trial Chamber therefore finds that the general requirements of Article 5 have been met.
</p>
<h4 class="text-left" id="tc-s-3081"><u>(c) Murder</u></h4>
<p id="tc-s-3082">738.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Trial Chamber previously noted, the elements of murder are the same under both Articles 3 and Article 5: the death of the victim, the causation of the death of the victim by the accused and the mens rea of the perpetrator.<a id="tc-s-3083" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="See supra paras 102-104."><sup>2097</sup></a>
</p>
<p id="tc-s-3084">739.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on the entire evidence in this case, the Trial Chamber has already found that VRS and/or MUP personnel perpetrated the killings specifically enumerated in Schedule D of the Indictment, except for scheduled incidents 3.1, 3.2, 4.2, 4.3 and 5.2. The Trial Chamber finds that the victims of these killings were Bosnian Muslim men who had surrendered or been captured from the column of men retreating from the Vlasenica enclave or had been separated at Potočari. Hence, the victims of these killings did not take an active part in the hostilities at the time they were killed and this was apparent to those involved. The Trial Chamber is also satisfied that the killings were intentional.
</p>
<p id="tc-s-3085">740.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Trial Chamber is therefore satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the aforementioned killings constitute murder, both as a crime against humanity and a violation of the laws or customs of war. Accordingly, the Trial Chamber finds that the crime of murder under Counts 9 and 10 of the Indictment has been established for the scheduled incidents described in Schedule D, except for incidents 3.1, 3.2, 4.2, 4.3 and 5.2. The individual criminal responsibility of the Accused for these crimes is discussed in sections VII-VIII of the Judgement.
</p>

<p id="tc-s-3087">741.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Count 11 of the Indictment charges the Accused with inhumane acts, as crimes against humanity under Article 5(i) of the Statute, including inflicting serious injuries, wounding and forcible transfer.<a id="tc-s-3088" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="See Indictment, Count 11."><sup>2098</sup></a>

<p id="tc-s-3090">742.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Trial Chamber previously noted, serious physical and mental injury or wounding are considered “inhumane acts” under Article 5(i) of the Statute.<a id="tc-s-3091" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="See supra para. 111."><sup>2099</sup></a>
As shown by the factual findings detailed above, the Bosnian Muslims detained in Potočari and elsewhere were subjected to horrific and inhumane conditions, as well as physical assaults.

Based on the factual findings detailed above, the Trial Chamber is satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that Bosnian Muslims in the area of Vlasenica suffered serious bodily or mental harm while in detention or in other locations, and that VRS and/or MUP personnel intentionally inflicted this suffering.
</p>
<h5 class="text-left" id="tc-s-3093"><u>(ii) Forcible Transfer</u></h5>
<p id="tc-s-3094">743.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The parties agreed that from July 1995 onwards, the Bosnian Muslim civilians who were bussed out of Potočari were not making a free choice to leave the area of the enclave; rather, they were forcibly transferred from the enclave by the VRS.<a id="tc-s-3095" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Vlasenica Agreed Facts, 3a."><sup>2101</sup></a>

The evidence is also clear that the perpetrators intended to forcibly transfer the Bosnian Muslim civilians from Potočari.
</p>
<p id="tc-s-3097">744.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Trial Chamber finds beyond reasonable doubt that the elements of the crime of forcible transfer with regard to the Bosnian Muslim civilians who were transported out of Potočari have been met and that the crime of forcible transfer was committed against them.
</p>
<p id="tc-s-3098">745.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Trial Chamber finds that these acts of forcible transfer are sufficiently serious to amount to “other inhumane acts” under Article 5(i) of the Statute.
</p>
<p id="tc-s-3099">746.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, the Trial Chamber is satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the crime of inhumane acts, including inflicting serious injuries, wounding and forcible transfer, as alleged in Count 11 of the Indictment, has been established.

<h4 class="text-left" id="tc-s-3100"><u>(e) Persecutions on Political, Racial or Religious Grounds</u></h4>
<p id="tc-s-3101">747.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Count 12 of the Indictment charges the Accused with persecutions on political, racial and religious grounds, a crime against humanity in violation of Article 5(h) of the Statute, through the underlying acts of murder, cruel and inhumane treatment and forcible transfer.<a id="tc-s-3102" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="See Indictment, Count 12."><sup>2103</sup></a>
The underlying acts of murder and forcible transfer have also been charged as separate crimes, and the elements have been dealt with separately above. It is, however, still required to determine whether they meet the requisite criteria for the crime of persecutions.

<h6 class="text-left"><u>a. Murder</u></h6>
<p id="tc-s-3104">748.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Trial Chamber recalls that it found that between 12 July 1995 and approximately 19
July 1995, thousands of captured Bosnian Muslim males were killed by VRS and/or MUP forces in several different locations in and around Vlasenica, Bratunac, and Zvornik.<a id="tc-s-3105" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="See supra paras 648, 655, 670, 674, 678, 688, 699, 704, 706, 714, 717, 723, 725."><sup>2104</sup></a>
Murder is enumerated in Article 5 of the Statute and by definition considered to be serious enough to amount to persecutions.
</p>
<p id="tc-s-3106">749.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the specific intent of the crime of persecutions, the Trial Chamber has considered the massive scale of the murder operation aimed at only one ethnic group, the Bosnian Muslims and the systematic manner in which it was carried out. As such, the Trial Chamber finds that these killings were committed against the Bosnian Muslims with a discriminatory intent on political, racial or religious grounds.
</p>
<h6 class="text-left" id="tc-s-3107"><u>b. Cruel and Inhumane Treatment</u></h6>
<p id="tc-s-3108">750.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Trial Chamber finds that, as described in detail above, the Bosnian Muslims detained in Potočari and elsewhere suffered serious bodily or mental harm caused by horrific and inhumane conditions, as well as physical assaults. The Trial Chamber further finds that this cruel and inhumane treatment is of equal gravity to the crimes listed in Article 5 and constitutes a blatant denial of fundamental rights that had a severe impact on the victims. The Trial Chamber therefore concludes that it amounts to an underlying act of persecutions.
</p>
<p id="tc-s-3109">751.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to specific intent, the Trial Chamber finds that Bosnian Muslim victims were subjected to cruel and inhumane treatment solely on the basis that they were Bosnian Muslims. The Trial Chamber concludes that the circumstances surrounding the infliction of the cruel and inhumane treatment demonstrate that it was carried out with the intention to discriminate against the Bosnian Muslims on political, racial or religious grounds.

<h6 class="text-left" id="tc-s-3110"><u>c. Forcible Transfer</u></h6>

<p id="tc-s-3113">753.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to specific intent, considering the issuance of Directive 7 and the other circumstances surrounding the transfer of the Bosnian Muslim civilians, the Trial Chamber is satisfied that the forcible transfer was carried out with the intent to discriminate against Bosnian Muslims on political, racial or religious grounds.
</p>
<h5 class="text-left" id="tc-s-3114"><u>(ii) Conclusion</u></h5>
<p id="tc-s-3115">754.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As noted above, the acts of murder, cruel and inhumane treatment and forcible transfer were committed against the Bosnian Muslims with a discriminatory intent. The Trial Chamber therefore concludes beyond a reasonable doubt that the underlying acts of murder, cruel and inhumane treatment and forcible transfer constitute persecutions as defined in Article 5 of the Statute. These underlying acts of persecution were committed in the context of a widespread and systematic attack and thus constitute crimes against humanity. Accordingly, the Trial Chamber is satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the crimes of murder, cruel and inhumane treatment and forcible transfer as underlying acts of persecution, as alleged in Count 12 of the Indictment, have been established.

<p id="tc-s-3117">755.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Count 13 of the Indictment charges the Accused with extermination, a crime against humanity, punishable under Article 5(b) of the Statute.<a id="tc-s-3118" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="See Indictment, Count 13."><sup>2106</sup></a>

In March 1993, Mladić sent a letter to Panić, then serving as Chief of VJ General Staff, which illustrates the shortcomings of this arrangement. Mladić complained that military personnel were leaving the VRS to return to the VJ without authorisation from the VRS Main Staff, stating that their deployment to the VRS from the VJ was only temporary.<a id="tc-s-3140" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Ex. P1529, Letter of Ratko Mladić to the Chief of the VJ General Staff, 31 March 1993, p. 1."><sup>2115</sup></a>
In Mladić’s words:

<div id="tc-s-3142" class="col-md-1"></div>
<div id="tc-s-3143" class="col-md-10"><small>			
The Main Staff of the VRS , since its establishment, believed that … the SVK, VRS and VJ were only separate elements of the combat disposition of a single army. We consider this assumption to be the legal basis for the obligatory engagement of members of the VJ regardless of their place of origin in the units of the VRS and its combat operations, and the engagement of
those whose roots are in the RS a moral and patriotic act and an obligation.<a id="tc-s-3144" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Ibid."><sup>2116</sup></a>

<p id="tc-s-3146">&nbsp;</p>
<p id="tc-s-3147">
Mladić therefore asked Panić to adopt “an enactment making it obligatory for all active military personnel who come from the former Bosnia and Herzegovina to join the VRS at the request of the Main Staff of the VRS ”. He also proposed that “ a ll those who refuse to comply with this request must be removed from the VJ in an appropriate procedure … ”.<a id="tc-s-3148" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Ex. P1529, Letter of Ratko Mladić to the Chief of the VJ General Staff, 31 March 1993, p. 2."><sup>2117</sup></a>
He also lamented that military personnel from the former JNA or VJ already serving in the VRS, were penalised in terms of rights and benefits compared to VJ personnel that remained in the FRY and asked that instead they be guaranteed equal treatment.<a id="tc-s-3149" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Ibid."><sup>2118</sup></a>
There is no evidence as to whether Panić took any steps in response to Mladić’s letter.
</p>
<p id="tc-s-3150">763.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After replacing Panić as Chief of VJ General Staff, Vuković took official steps to answer Mladić’s request. In late September or early October 1993, Vuković sent a proposed order to Lilić regarding the regulation of the status and dispatch of military personnel to the VRS and SVK.<a id="tc-s-3151" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Ex. P1873, Set of VJ General Staff and FRY MOD Documents, Doc IDs 0630-6535, 0630-6536. See also Ex. P778, Stenographic Transcript of the 25th Session of the SDC, 30 August 1994, p. 66."><sup>2119</sup></a>
The statement of reasons for this proposal expressly stated that since the withdrawal of the JNA from the territories of the Former Yugoslavia, three issues remained open: i) the legal status and rights of JNA military personnel who remained in the VRS and SVK; ii) the fact that there was no legal basis to temporarily dispatch VJ military personnel to the VRS and SVK; and iii) the enjoyment of rights (salaries, housing, promotions, personal record in the VJ, etc.) of all of the above personnel in the VJ and FRY.<a id="tc-s-3152" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Ex. P1873, Set of VJ General Staff and FRY MOD Documents, Doc ID 0630-6538, p. 1."><sup>2120</sup></a>
The statements of reasons also indicated that until then, the Chief of the VJ General Staff dealt with these issues based on temporary “standpoints”, “without any legal basis and in a semi legal manner”.<a id="tc-s-3153" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Ibid."><sup>2121</sup></a>
The proposal also included termination of service as a sanction in case of refusal to comply with the transfer order.<a id="tc-s-3154" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Ex. P1873, Set of VJ General Staff and FRY MOD Documents, Doc IDs 0630-6538, p. 2, 0630-6536, p. 2."><sup>2122</sup></a>
The proposed order – with a minor revision and a more detailed statement of reasons – was inserted in the agenda for discussion at the SDC session of 11 October 1993.<a id="tc-s-3155" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="The revision was made at the proposal of the Administration for System and Status-Related Issues of the FRY MOD and concerned the addition of persons born in Bosnia and Croatia who had been dispatched from there to the JNA for trainings or service in the JNA to the list of those for whom the VJ General Staff had to keep record of, Ex.

</p>
<p id="tc-s-3156">764.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the new statement of reasons, Vuković reiterated that there was no “solid legal framework” for sending VJ personnel outside of the FRY without their consent. As a consequence, this could expose the VJ to potential litigation and exposure to the “local and foreign public”.<a id="tc-s-3157" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Ex. P1872, Set of VJ General Staff and FRY MOD Documents, Doc ID 0630-6544, p. 2."><sup>2124</sup></a>
In Vuković’s view, the proposed order therefore represented “the only possible solution … given the current circumstances, the position of the FRY and VJ and fulfilment of the request of the Main Staffs of the VRS and SVK ”.<a id="tc-s-3158" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Ibid."><sup>2125</sup></a>
He then described the mechanism through which VJ personnel would serve in the VRS and SVK:
</p>
<div id="tc-s-3159" class="row">
<div id="tc-s-3160" class="col-md-1"></div>
<div id="tc-s-3161" class="col-md-10"><small>			
The relevant officer in the VJ would make all these persons available and send them to a special organ of the VJ General Staff (Personnel Administration) based in Belgrade. Further procedure to organise and implement the departure of these persons and resolve their status in service while they are outside of the VJ will be taken over by the authorised organs of the Main Staff of the VRS or SVK . All the rights of these active servicemen and civilians would be fully protected and
enjoyed in the same manner and scope as for other professionals in the VJ.<a id="tc-s-3162" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Ibid."><sup>2126</sup></a>

<div id="tc-s-3163" class="col-md-1"></div>
</div>
<p id="tc-s-3164">&nbsp;</p>
<p id="tc-s-3165">
The most contentious issue was the termination of service of those military personnel who refused redeployment to the VRS and SVK. As there was no direct legal basis for the said termination, Vuković proposed alternative means to achieve it, including early retirement, termination due to special needs of service and interests of the VJ or by order of a military disciplinary court for refusal to carry out an order.<a id="tc-s-3166" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Ex.

</p>
<p id="tc-s-3167">765.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the SDC session of 11 October 1993, Vuković presented his proposed order to Zoran Lilić, Slobodan Milošević and Momir Bulatović:
</p>
<div id="tc-s-3168" class="row">

<div id="tc-s-3170" class="col-md-10"><small>			
These are personnel issues related to officers in the VRS and SVK . We have 3,612 people there whose status has not been regulated under the new law. In order to have a foothold, we have paved the way for the President of the state, in his capacity as Supreme Commander, to issue an order regulating their status and that of officers here. And in order to avoid having anyone criticise us, we have devised a temporary formation in the VJ . We appoint them here; they are not actually here but are performing their duties over where they are stationed. … We must create a stronghold so that the General Staff can work on these issues to a certain extent within the spirit of the law, even though this is not entirely in conformity with the law. But we cannot see a better
solution.<a id="tc-s-3171" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Ex. P709, Stenographic Transcript of the 14th Session of the SDC, 11 October 1993, p. 32 (emphasis added)."><sup>2128</sup></a>

<p id="tc-s-3173">&nbsp;</p>
<p id="tc-s-3174">766.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vuković then proceeded to explain the issue of ordering VJ officers to perform their duties in the VRS and SVK in order to meet these armies’ pressing requests for military personnel. According to Vuković, VJ soldiers who refused such a transfer order should be considered deserters.<a id="tc-s-3175" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Ex.

Vuković also stated that he had found the appropriate solutions to deal with those who refused to respond to the call, including early retirement:
</p>

<div id="tc-s-3177" class="col-md-1"></div>
<div id="tc-s-3178" class="col-md-10"><small>			
For instance, if someone doesn’t want to go and has over 30 years of pensionable employment, we can give him early retirement so that we’re not accepting this. We’ll tell him that he is not performing his duties in a satisfactory manner and other things, but we won’t write that he did not want to go there.<a id="tc-s-3179" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Ex.

<p id="tc-s-3182">767.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Momir Bulatović, though in favour of obligatory deployment, expressed concern that such a coercive method would become public and suggested that the order be revised in that regard.<a id="tc-s-3183" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Ex. P709, Stenographic Transcript of the 14th Session of the SDC, 11 October 1993, pp 33-36. Vuković stated “ j ust so we do not have to wait for the next Council session, should I throw out everything that pertains to repressive actions – if they wont go – and leave everything else in the order?”; Lilić responded that the matter would have to be discussed at the next Council session, ibid., pp 35, 37."><sup>2131</sup></a>
To meet this concern, Vuković amended the order and presented the new version at the following SDC session held on 10 November.<a id="tc-s-3184" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Ex.

Although the new version of the draft order did not contain any reference to the termination of service of VJ members who refused to transfer to the VRS or SVK, it suggested that such refusal would have an adverse impact on the future promotion of those soldiers within the VJ. Vuković eventually agreed to delete that part of the draft, accepting Milošević’s remark that the addition was superfluous, as the power to refuse promotion was already within Vuković’s purview.<a id="tc-s-3185" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Ex.

<p id="tc-s-3221">777.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Trial Chamber finds that Vuković had a decisive role in the creation of the PCs. The evidence set out above shows that he conceived and subsequently carefully implemented the idea to create such centres to: (i) regularise the status of all former JNA and VJ military personnel who remained in BiH and Croatia and (ii) to legalise, as far as possible, the deployment of VJ military personnel to the VRS and SVK. In doing so, Vuković intended to meet the requests for military personnel by the VRS and SVK Main Staffs. The statement of reasons accompanying the proposed order on the creation of the PCs, as well as the discussions held during the SDC sessions of

In the Prosecution’s theory, Vuković created the PCs with the excuse of keeping a record of the members of the former JNA or VJ born in Croatia and Bosnia who joined the SVK or VRS, while his real purpose was to find a legal cover to dispatch VJ soldiers to participate in the war in Bosnia and Croatia.

<p id="tc-s-3260">785.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Trial Chamber further notes that Exhibit P1523 also illustrates this covert transfer of VJ officers through the PCs. Exhibit P1523 is an order of the Chief of the Personnel Administration of the VJ General Staff dated 15 February 1994 which appoints Bogdan Sladojević and Milan
Čeleketić to the 11th and 18th Corps, respectively, of the 40th PC.<a id="tc-s-3261" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Ex. P1523, Order by VJ General Staff Personnel Administration, 15 February 1994, pp 2-3."><sup>2176</sup></a>

In addition, Nikolić commented on the date “101193” (10 November 1993) printed in relation to each officer’s appointment and explained that the date was a code for Lilić’s order of 10 November 1993 regarding the formation of the PCs.<a id="tc-s-3265" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Stamenko Nikolić, T. 10604-10605; Ex.

The witness added that Sladojević had been transferred to the SVK before 15 February 1994 and that, in his view, the Chief of Personnel Administration

equipment to the PCs.<a id="tc-s-3268" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Ex. P1009, Order of the President of the FRY, 18 February 1994."><sup>2182</sup></a>

<p id="tc-s-3269">787.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, the Trial Chamber is satisfied that the PCs’ main function was to regulate the status of all those former JNA/VJ officers who remained to serve in the SVK and VRS after the withdrawal of the JNA and to allow the VJ to secretly transfer VJ military personnel to the VRS and SVK, ensuring that they all continued to enjoy and exercise their rights in the VJ and FRY while serving in those armies. To this end, the PCs accessory function was to keep record of all former JNA and VJ personnel serving in the VRS and SVK. The Trial Chamber is equally satisfied that all the SDC members, as well as Vuković, intended to keep this function and the VJ involvement in the conflicts secret in order to avoid criticism or risking further sanctions from the international community. As described above, under the cover of a formal appointment to the PCs, VJ personnel were transferred directly to the VRS and SVK. The need and intention to keep this function secret was clearly expressed at the SDC session of 11 October 1993 while discussing the order on the establishment of the PCs. Vuković admitted that the establishment of the PCs had been devised in order to “avoid having anyone criticise us” for the number of former JNA and VJ personnel serving in the VRS and SVK.<a id="tc-s-3270" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Ex P709, Stenographic Transcript of the 14th Session of the SDC, 11 October 1993, p. 32."><sup>2183</sup></a>

<p id="tc-s-3347">797.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evidence shows that VJ officers were transferred and/or appointed to the 30th or 40th PCs by the VJ, whereas the VRS and SVK appointed these officers to specific posts within these armies.<a id="tc-s-3348" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Ex.

In its closing arguments, the Prosecution did not dispute that the “VRS and the SVK made the majority of decisions as to assignment to duty within those armies”, Prosecution Closing Arguments, T. 14689."><sup>2242</sup></a>
While accepting this as the general rule, the Prosecution argues that on occasion, the VJ would also appoint PC members to specific posts within the VRS. The prosecution relies on two orders of appointment, dated 12 August and 6 October 1995, regarding, inter alia, Vujadin Popović
and Dragan Obrenović.<a id="tc-s-3349" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Prosecution Final Brief, para. 183, referring to Ex.

The Prosecution points out that in these cases, the order of transfer and appointment of VJ military personnel to the VRS through the PCs included internal appointments to different units within those armies - namely to the positions of Corps Chief of Security Department, Security and Intelligence Affairs and Infantry Brigade Chief of Staff, respectively.<a id="tc-s-3350" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Prosecution Final Brief, para. 183."><sup>2244</sup></a>
</p>
<p id="tc-s-3351">798.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Defence disputes the proposition that the VJ could decide on appointments within the
VRS and SVK and submits that such decisions were independently made by these armies.<a id="tc-s-3352" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Defence Final Brief, paras 272-301."><sup>2245</sup></a>
</p>
<p id="tc-s-3353">799.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Trial Chamber notes that both Popović and Obrenović held the positions of Corps Chief of Security Department, Security and Intelligence Affairs and Infantry Brigade Chief of Staff, respectively, before the VJ orders of appointment cited by the Prosecution were issued. The order of 12 August 1995 on Popović’s appointment, states that the appointment was effective as of 1
February 1995, “when he assumed duty”.<a id="tc-s-3354" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Ex. P2126, Order by VJ General Staff Personnel Administration, 12 August 1995, p. 14."><sup>2246</sup></a>
This is reflected in his VJ personnel file.<a id="tc-s-3355" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Ex. P1934, VJ Personnel File of Vujadin Popović, Doc ID 0422-8609, p. 2."><sup>2247</sup></a>
Similarly, the appointment order of 6 October 1995 relating to Obrenović states that his appointment to Chief of Staff of the Infantry Brigade was effective as of 1 August 1995, “when changes were effected in the unit establishment”.<a id="tc-s-3356" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Ex. P1815, Order by VJ General Staff, 6 October 1995, p. 26."><sup>2248</sup></a>
In addition, Obrenović was already “transferred and appointed” to the same position by VJ order of 9 February 1994, effective as of 10 November 1993.<a id="tc-s-3357" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Ex. P2129, Order by VJ General Staff Personnel Administration, 9 February 1994, p. 35."><sup>2249</sup></a>
As discussed above, these orders of February 1994, were issued to harmonise the status of VJ personnel already serving in the VRS or SVK with Lilić’s order establishing the PCs.<a id="tc-s-3358" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="See supra para. 785."><sup>2250</sup></a>
The evidence therefore shows that contrary to the Prosecution position, Popović and Obrenović were not appointed to those specific positions within the VRS by VJ order. The Trial Chamber therefore finds that while the VJ appointed VJ personnel to the 30th and 40th PCs, the appointment to specific posts within the VRS and SVK was done by those armies.

<p id="tc-s-3359">800.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Trial Chamber was also presented with evidence of instances in which VJ soldiers were appointed to the VRS or SVK on a temporary basis through the PCs.

The document states that the transfers would last one year, in accordance with Article 58(3) of the Law on the VJ, and that upon termination the two officers were to return to the unit/institution from which they were transferred.<a id="tc-s-3368" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Ex.

<p id="tc-s-3372">802.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also evidence that some secondments were made directly to the VRS without going through the 30th PC. For example, in March 1994, Panić, the Commander of the Special Units Corps (“SUC”), agreed to send two sergeants to the VRS for one year pursuant to Article 58 of the Law on the VJ, with the understanding that the two soldiers were not appointed to the 30th PC and that they would return to the SUC before the expiration of the year in case of engagement of the SUC in combat.<a id="tc-s-3373" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Ex.

<p id="tc-s-3377">803.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As discussed earlier, the order establishing the PCs did not contain any provision on the termination of service of VJ members who refused to comply with a transfer order to the PCs. Vuković, however, made it clear that those VJ officers who refused to take up positions in the SVK or VRS would be in one way or another dismissed from the VJ.<a id="tc-s-3378" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="See supra paras 764-768.

This policy did not change over time and Vuković addressed the issue during the SDC meeting of 21 July 1994. In discussing the potential deployment of 1,143 men to the VRS and SVK, Vuković stressed that he could “only persuade them and they go or force them out of the VJ in another way”.<a id="tc-s-3379" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Ex. P785, Stenographic Transcript of the 23rd Session of the SDC, 21 July 1994, p. 20."><sup>2260</sup></a>

The SDC finally decided that the deployment of VJ officers to the VRS and SVK should continue, while concluding that it was necessary to maintain the appearance that these officers were going on a voluntary basis and that Vuković would deal with those who refused.<a id="tc-s-3381" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Ex.

<p id="tc-s-3382">804.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Trial Chamber notes that several witnesses contested that such practice in fact took shape. Siniša Borović commented on two requests from the VRS to Vuković, dated respectively April and May 1995, regarding the provision of specific VJ officers.<a id="tc-s-3383" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Ex.

consultation with the requested officers.<a id="tc-s-3384" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Ibid."><sup>2264</sup></a>

Petar Škrbić testified that in 1992, those JNA/VJ officers who did not leave for the VRS were “castigated” whereas those that did were “encouraged and respected by their peers”.<a id="tc-s-3386" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Petar Škrbić, T. 11592-11593."><sup>2266</sup></a>

<p id="tc-s-3389">805.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Trial Chamber, however, notes that contrary to the abovementioned testimony, the record contains a solid body of evidence showing that officers assigned to the 30th and 40th PCs in fact did not have much choice in whether they were transferred. For example, on 5 September 1994, the Chief of the VJ General Staff ordered the deployment of a number of VJ officers to the 40th PC, but a number of them either refused to obey the order or subsequently and deliberately left the units of the 40th PC.<a id="tc-s-3390" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Ex.

<p id="tc-s-3434">813.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prosecution submits that officers moved fluidly between the VRS, SVK and VJ pursuant to Vuković’s orders and based on the needs of service of the VJ.<a id="tc-s-3435" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Prosecution Final Brief, paras 190, 197-198."><sup>2296</sup></a>
The Prosecution acknowledges that, as stated in the VJ General Staff Instructions, officers’ requests to return to the VJ were reviewed by, and required the consent of the respective VRS or SVK commanders.<a id="tc-s-3436" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Prosecution Closing Arguments, T. 14686-14687, discussing Ex.

However, the Prosecution asserts that the VJ, and Vuković personally, was the ultimate authority on whether an individual served in one of the PCs or in the FRY, and that where the needs of the VJ overrode those of the SVK or VRS, officers were required to return to the FRY.<a id="tc-s-3439" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Prosecution Final Brief, para. 192; Prosecution Closing Arguments, T. 14689."><sup>2300</sup></a>

<p id="tc-s-3440">814.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Defence argues that the VRS and SVK, not the VJ, made the final decisions regarding the redeployment of officers to the VJ.<a id="tc-s-3441" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Defence Final Brief, para. 309."><sup>2301</sup></a>
The Defence does not dispute that, in some instances, officers were permitted to return to the VJ at their own request, but maintains that individual requests by VRS and SVK officers to redeploy to the VJ were reviewed and decided upon by commanders of the VRS and SVK.<a id="tc-s-3442" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Defence Final Brief, paras 309-310, 322."><sup>2302</sup></a>

<p id="tc-s-3445">815.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evidence shows instances where members of the PCs requested permission to leave their positions in the VRS and SVK and be redeployed to the VJ. Moreover, at least some of these requests were sent directly to units within the VRS or SVK, not to the VJ. For example, on 16
August 1994, Miroslav Dadić sent a request to the Drina Corps Command to be redeployed from Military Post 7111 to his original unit in the VJ, wherein he explained that he went to the VRS voluntarily for a three-month period and was told that he would only be there on a “temporary basis”.<a id="tc-s-3446" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Ex.

The request was however forwarded back to Miličić’s commanding officer in the 1st Zvornik Infantry Brigade Command of the Drina Corps, with a request that he “read it carefully … and to give his opinion and return to this Command as soon as possible”.<a id="tc-s-3448" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Ibid."><sup>2306</sup></a>
</p>
<p id="tc-s-3449">816.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Trial Chamber was presented with instances where the VRS approved such redeployment requests made by personnel before redeployment to the VJ could take effect. For example, on 18 April 1996, Mladić sent a letter “to the 30th PC”, approving the request to transfer Dragomir Milošević from his position as Commander of the SRK in the VRS to the VJ, stating that
he should be “transferred and appointed according to the needs of the service to the VJ ”.<a id="tc-s-3450" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Ex. D120 (under seal)."><sup>2307</sup></a>

Similarly, on 25 December 1996, the VRS Main Staff sent a letter, signed by Škrbić, to Savo Jojić informing him that his “request for transfer to the VJ outside of the 30th PC was discussed at the Advisory Board” of the Commander of the VRS Main Staff. At the meeting, a decision was made to forward the request to the 30th PC “for deliberation with a proposal to the officer in charge to issue an order for transfer to the VJ outside the 30th PC ”.<a id="tc-s-3452" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Ex.

All the requests for transfer to the VJ were discussed at … the collegium meeting of the commander of the Main Staff.

Due to dealing with other important combat issues at the time, Mladić stated that: “[P]recisely for this reason, we are not able to review and decide on requests for transfer to [the] VJ, except in emergency cases, i.e. personal sickness, or that of a family member”.<a id="tc-s-3462" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Ex.

</p>
<p id="tc-s-3463">818.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other instances the VRS Main Staff denied requests from members of the 30th PC to be redeployed to the VJ, due to needs of the army or because adequate replacements were not available.<a id="tc-s-3464" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Ex.

<p id="tc-s-3519">830.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on the foregoing, the Trial Chamber finds that as a rule, personnel serving in the VRS and SVK through the 30th and 40th PCs could be redeployed to VJ units. The evidence clearly shows that when the request for redeployment came from the PC member himself, it was granted only if his superior in the VRS or SVK consented to such transfer; subsequently, the VJ would order the transfer. At the same time, the record contains some VJ orders of transfer initiated by the VJ, rather than by the PC member, transferring both 30th and 40th PC members back to the VJ, without evidence of prior approval from the VRS or the SVK. However, in light of the testimony of Škrbić and Gajić, the Trial Chamber cannot conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that these VJ orders for redeployment could be carried out without approval from the VRS and SVK.

<p id="tc-s-3533">835.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several judgements issued by the Military Supreme Court in Belgrade in relation to claims filed by members of the 30th and 40th PCs for compensation of unused annual leave during the war confirmed that those members retained their status as VJ members while serving in the VRS and SVK.<a id="tc-s-3534" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Ex.

In all of these cases, the parties did not dispute that during the period for which compensation was sought, the officers, as VJ members, were serving outside the VJ on orders of a superior officer and that they did not use their annual leave. The Military Supreme Court reversed the decision of the PCs denying those claims and affirmed that because the claimants were professional soldiers of the VJ during the period in question, the provisions of the Law on the VJ applied to them.<a id="tc-s-3535" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Ibid."><sup>2351</sup></a>

<div id="tc-s-3537" class="col-md-1"></div>
<div id="tc-s-3538" class="col-md-10"><small>
It is the legal understanding of the Court that the legal position of a serviceman whom the competent officer sent outside the VJ and who did not take his annual leave due to a raised level of combat readiness and engagement in combat operations, is to be brought in line with the position of a serviceman whose annual leave was suspended or cut short by the Chief of the VJ General Staff due to extraordinary needs of service.<a id="tc-s-3539" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Ex.

<p id="tc-s-3545">837.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the Trial Chamber particularly notes that the Second Municipal Court in Belgrade concluded that Dragomir Milošević retained the status as a VJ member throughout the period he served in the VRS. The case concerned a lawsuit filed by Dragomir Milošević against the FRY for compensation of non-material damages suffered following his wounding on the battlefield near Sarajevo on 17 May 1995.<a id="tc-s-3546" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Ex.

P822, Judgement of the 2nd Municipal Court, Belgrade, 9 July 2001."><sup>2355</sup></a>
The FRY, represented by the Military Legal Office of the VJ, argued that Milošević did not have the passive legitimacy to make such a claim, because at the time of the wounding he was a member of the VRS and not of the VJ.<a id="tc-s-3547" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Ex.

<div id="tc-s-3550" class="col-md-1"></div>
<div id="tc-s-3551" class="col-md-10"><small>
The court is of the opinion that this objection was not valid since, based on the evidence presented during the proceedings, it was established beyond reasonable doubt that the plaintiff was a professional officer of the VJ at the time of wounding and was on its payroll throughout that time and that his participation on the front in the general sector of Zlatište near Sarajevo was certainly in agreement with or with the knowledge of the General Staff of the VJ . Had that not been the case, an unauthorized arrival of the plaintiff as a professional officer of the VJ at the front in another, internationally recognized state would have resulted in the termination of his employment, and neither did his superior ever initiate such a measure against the plaintiff, nor was evidence to that effect presented before this court by the end of the proceedings.<a id="tc-s-3552" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Ex.

<h5> <u>(iii)&nbsp;The Effect of the “Verification”</u> </h5>
<p id="tc-s-3605">851.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both Defence and Prosecution witnesses articulated the significance and effect of VJ verifications. Malčić testified that verification was a formal recognition of a VRS rank by the VJ, which was necessary for the calculation of the new salary:
</p>
<div id="tc-s-3606" style="padding-left: 5em; padding-right: 5em" class="small"><p id="tc-s-3607">The basic idea was that officers should be appointed and promoted in accordance with the regulations of the Army of Republika Srpska. However, in order for them to receive salaries, this had to be accorded with regulations in the Army of Yugoslavia. That is to say that we had two systems of laws, if I can put it that way, according to which we worked, the laws of Republika Srpska; and in order to have that verified, it had to be adjusted to the regulations in the Army of
Yugoslavia so that it could be sent to the accounting centre so their salaries could be calculated.

These included the promotion within the VRS of Dušan Kovačević and Bodgan Subotić to the rank of Major General, and within the SVK of Mile Novaković and Borislav Đukić to the rank of Major General.

Through the PCs, therefore, Vuković had at his disposal information on all personnel serving in the PCs. Against this backdrop and considering the SDC session records discussed above, the Trial Chamber finds that Vuković was personally aware of the character and performance of members of the PCs proposed for promotion verification. He therefore had information available that he would assess to decide whether those officers were suitable for a promotion within the VJ. After such assessment - for officers submitted for verification to the rank of General - Vuković would make proposals before the SDC on their suitability for promotion in the VJ.

<h5> <u>(v)&nbsp;Final Findings</u> </h5>
<p id="tc-s-3668">866.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In sum, the Trial Chamber finds that as a general rule, promotions were first granted in the VRS and SVK in accordance with the laws of the RS and RSK, respectively. The VRS and SVK Main Staffs would then send a list of promotions to the VJ General Staff with a request that they be verified. The Trial Chamber is also satisfied that the verification and promotions within the VJ were made according to the Law on the VJ. Hence, Vuković retained the authority to promote members of the PCs up to and including the rank of Colonel and had the power of proposal to the FRY President for exceptional promotion to the rank of General. The Trial Chamber also finds that Vuković decided whether a promotion in the VJ was merited based on his own assessment of character and performance of the members of the PCs proposed for promotion verification. Finally, the verification and corresponding promotion in the VJ allowed the PC members to enjoy the benefits and rights attached to the new rank, most importantly a commensurate salary.

<p id="tc-s-3700">873.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Law on the VJ provided the legal framework for the determination of salary and other forms of remuneration of military personnel. It defined the different elements of the salary structure as well as the circumstances in which payments could be reduced or suspended. The salary of military personnel was calculated based on rank, position and length of service. The salary structure included the so-called “military supplement” or “army addition”, as well as compensations (such as compensation for service under special conditions).

<sup>2534</sup> </a>
Specifically, on 18 May 1994 and later, on 8 April 1997, Mladić was granted compensation for “expenses incurred for living apart from his family”.

<sup>2535</sup> </a>
The decision of 8 April 1997 refers specifically to the fact that although Mladić was not provided an “official apartment at his place of service”, he was provided with accommodation at the military facility at Han Pijesak garrison where he was serving.
<a id="tc-s-3800" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ex. P2045, Military Post 7403 Decision, 8 April 1997; Ex.

">
<sup>2536</sup> </a>
Additionally, both decisions confirm that Mladić had a separate family residence in Belgrade, while the 8 April 1997 decision further indicates that Mladić was “relocated from the Belgrade Garrison, where he had a settled housing issue/permanent housing provided/, to the Han Pijesak Garrison … ”.

<h5> <u>(ii)&nbsp;Final Findings</u> </h5>
<p id="tc-s-3945">933.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Trial Chamber finds that pursuant to the Law on the VJ, the FRY President and Vuković possessed the authority to terminate the professional military service of personnel assigned to the 30th and 40th PCs. Furthermore, both the FRY President and Vuković exercised this authority, as demonstrated by the numerous examples of decrees and orders terminating the military service of personnel serving in the PCs.
</p>
<p id="tc-s-3946">934.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Trial Chamber further finds that the RS presidential decrees and corresponding VRS Military Post decisions relied on by the Defence to demonstrate that termination of service for members of the 30th PC was only within the purview of the RS and VRS were, in fact, issued after the war and following the disbandment of the 30th PC. As a result, the Trial Chamber is not convinced that this practice calls into question Vuković’s authority to terminate the military service of the members of the 30th PC.
</p> 
<p id="tc-s-3947">935.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Trial Chamber finds that the evidence does not support the Defence argument that the decrees issued by Vuković or by the FRY President on termination of service for members of the PCs were preceded by RS Presidential Decrees, nor that such decrees were only issued to regulate status-related rights of the concerned personnel.

<p id="tc-s-3978">942.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conversely, the Defence generally submits that, under FRY law and procedure, the SDC and FRY MOD—not Vuković and the VJ General Staff—held the primary authority over the logistical assistance process.

The Defence contends that Vuković, being a subordinate in the process, had no control over the decision of the SDC and FRY MOD to give logistical assistance to the VRS, and therefore “cannot be held legally responsible for making governmental policy since he had neither the position nor authority to make policy”.

In the Defence’s view, Vuković’s role in the logistical assistance process was essentially limited to giving certain quantities of materiel that would not endanger the VJ’s reserves, pursuant to the orders of the SDC and the authorisation of the FRY MOD.

Mladić reported to the RS National Assembly that, with regard to weaponry used in battle from the beginning of the war until 15 April 1995, merely 9.11% of the total infantry ammunition was “imported, i.e. bought” whereas 47.2% came from VJ “aid”, only 0.26% of expanded artillery ammunition was imported/bought whereas 34.4% came from VJ “aid”, and 4.9% of anti-aircraft ammunition was imported/bought whereas 52.4% came from VJ “aid”.

Mladić’s report therefore demonstrates that a far greater proportion of the VRS’s ammunition came from VJ “aid” than from the special purpose industries, as otherwise demonstrated by the vast majority of the evidence adduced on this issue.

<h3 id="tc-s-4259" class="text-center"> <u>7. Conclusion</u> </h3>
<p id="tc-s-4260">1007.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The foregoing evidence conclusively demonstrates that Borislav Vuković, as Chief of the VJ General Staff, oversaw the administration of logistical assistance for the military needs of the VRS and SVK. In fact, Vuković convinced the SDC to give him the legal authority to do so in an effort to comply with the FRY’s Law on Property.
<a id="tc-s-4261" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Ex. P782, Stenographic Transcript of 18th Session of the SDC, 7 February 1994, p. 53; Ex. P1009, Order of FRY President, 18 February 1994.
">
<sup>2863</sup> </a>
That being noted, the Trial Chamber considers that the question of greater relevance is not what the FRY’s domestic legislation technically stipulated, but the actual role that Vuković played in the logistical assistance process.
</p> 
<p id="tc-s-4262">1008.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vuković’s role went beyond administering the logistical assistance process. Vuković participated in the SDC’s deliberations on logistical assistance to the VRS and SVK, and recurrently encouraged the SDC to maintain this assistance, thereby helping craft the FRY’s policy to aid these armies.
</p> 
<p id="tc-s-4263">1009.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Insofar as Vuković opposed certain requests conflicting with the VJ’s own needs, that fact does not signify that Vuković generally opposed logistical assistance or sought to keep it to a minimum. Rather, Vuković’s role in coordinating the process, his statements before the SDC, and his approval of extensive assistance to the VRS and SVK

<sup>2864</sup> </a>
demonstrate that he was intent on assisting these armies. Vuković’s remarks before the VJ Collegium at the end of the war are equally instructive: “I could have retained the material reserves, all the material reserves to retain them here to the maximum, to give as little as possible material reserves away …. We gave all we had always and I am not sorry for that, as we defended the people as much as we could”.

See Miodrag Starčević, T. 6787-6788. An undated document from “the logistics sector”, presumably of the VJ, states that all the VRS and SVK requests had been met that far, although further provisions would only be possible from the “surplus of unpromising equipment”. The document adds that the VJ does not have the financial capacity to provide weaponry produced by FRY factories to the VRS and SVK. The latter “should” make arrangements through the FRY MOD so that weaponry can be delivered from the “production sector, with the funding plan ensured”. The document adds that the VJ “can still provide ammunition for 7.9 calibre weapons from its own surpluses”, whereas it can no longer give fuel because “its own reserves have dropped below the allowed minimum”. It goes on to reach the following conclusion: “The VJ has depleted its capabilities, reserves and resources of logistical support and the only logistical support it can provide is insufficient for the actual needs of the VRS and VRSK [<i>sic</i>] ”, Ex. P2175, Documents Regarding Meetings between SVK, VRS and VJ Chiefs of Staff, fall 1993, Doc ID 0630-5913 (undated), pp 1, 3. See Mile Novaković, T. 13189-13191. The Trial Chamber finds this document relevant, but considers its weight undermined by the fact that it is undated and its author is unnamed. In any event, the Trial Chamber finds that extensive evidence shows that the VJ continued to assist the VRS and SVK despite problems with its reserves.

<p id="tc-s-4281">1013.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Defence raises multiple challenges to the material delivery forms, namely that various forms were not properly filled in, that they are unintelligible, that they do not adequately identify the sender and recipient, that they do not establish whether listed items were actually delivered, and that they do not reflect Vuković’s approval.

<p id="tc-s-4295">1017.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the outset, the Trial Chamber notes both the box for “unit of measure” and the box for “quantity” are filled in on certain forms.

</p> 
<p id="tc-s-4300">1018.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kodžopeljić challenged the intelligibility of several material forms. The Trial Chamber does not find him credible in his claim that Ex. P574 is so unclear that “practically one cannot know in any way whatsoever what particular item has been delivered or issued”, notably because the nomenclature number on the form was incorrect.

">
<sup>2892</sup> </a>
The Trial Chamber finds Kodžopeljić unpersuasive. Even though an improper nomenclature number might pose problems for tracking information in that database, it does not render a material list unintelligible if one can read on its face the names of the items provided.

</p> 
<p id="tc-s-4306">1019.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to Ex. P572, Kodžopeljić recognised that the form indicates the sender as the VJ General Staff and the origin as Ladjeveci, Serbia, although he claimed that this information was “insufficient” for purposes of VJ administrative and financial planning, and posited that “the handwriting is the same as that of the person who has received the item”.

<sup>2894</sup> </a>
The Trial Chamber considers that whether a form has sufficient information for purposes of VJ administrative and financial planning is irrelevant and does not render a delivery form incomprehensible on its face. Assuming Kodžopeljić was correct in stating that the person who filled out the form was the recipient, that fact alone would not render the form unreliable. MP-14’s testimony suggests that this fact would be unremarkable, as it was possible for the recipient to complete details in the paperwork omitted by the sender.

<p id="tc-s-4325">1024.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Trial Chamber’s analysis of the material delivery forms indicates that multiple forms feature several boxes left unfilled.

The Trial Chamber does not find such omissions material so long as the form identifies the items supplied, their quantity, the sender, the recipient, and the date of conveyance or receipt.
</p> 
<p id="tc-s-4329">1025.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Trial Chamber notes that various forms are not stamped by both the sender and the recipient; and some also feature boxes that have not been filled in with information indicating the identity of the VJ member who approved the delivery, although a separate control signature may have been appended.

The Trial Chamber considers that a sending stamp or signature raises a presumption of delivery. The FRY-RS border was porous and the VJ could easily send large quantities of weaponry to the VRS with minimal risk that any weapons would be intercepted by international border monitors.

The Trial Chamber finds that the mere fact that some boxes were left blank on a delivery form featuring multiple boxes does not raise a reasonable doubt as to the reliability of the forms. The Trial Chamber notes that MP-14 acknowledged that most material delivery forms were “incomplete”, but credibly explained that, in times of war, it was “practically impossible” to follow all rules and regulations regarding paperwork, partly because there was insufficient manpower to do so.

However, for all of the aforesaid reasons, the Trial Chamber finds Kod`opeljić to have minimal credibility. The Chamber additionally notes that Kodžopeljić was not credible in claiming that he essentially did not know the VJ’s 30th PC’s functions or why the 30th PC was listed as the recipient on certain material delivery lists, despite having been the Chief of Technical Administration for the VJ General Staff’s logistics sector from 1993 until 1999.

<p id="tc-s-4348">1029.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In light of the occurrence of unauthorised logistical assistance, the Trial Chamber has decided to rely on material delivery forms and reports that either mention Vuković’s approval or indicate that supplies were sent by the VJ General Staff itself, as opposed to merely the VJ generally.
