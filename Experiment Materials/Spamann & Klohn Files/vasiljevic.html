                <h1 id="p-v-45" class="text-center">I. INTRODUCTION</h1>

                <p id="p-v-46">
                    1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The municipality of Višegrad is located in south-eastern Bosnia and
                    Herzegovina. Its main town, Višegrad, is situated on the eastern bank of the Drina River. In 1991,
                    about 63% of the population was Muslim and 33% was Serb. Elections were held in the municipality in
                    November 1990; the result, which closely matched the ethnic composition of the municipality, led to
                    mounting tensions. In early April 1991, after requests from the Serb politicians to divide the
                    police along ethnic lines, both groups raised barricades around Višegrad, and over the following
                    months random acts of shooting and shelling occurred. The Yugoslav National Army (JNA) arrived on 14
                    April 1992, and this at first had a calming effect. However, on 19 May 1992, the JNA withdrew from
                    Višegrad and various Serb para-military units took control. One such group, with a reputation for
                    being particularly violent, was led by Milan Lukić (Milan Lukić group). Although Mitar Vasiljević
                    (Appellant) was not part of the Milan Lukić group, the Trial Chamber found that he was associated
                    with the group and acted as an informant to it. Sometime in May 1992, the Appellant was present when
                    Milan Lukić and his men searched the village of Musići. The Trial Chamber found that on 7 June 1992,
                    the Appellant, together with Milan Lukić and two unidentified men, forcibly transported seven Muslim
                    men to the eastern bank of the Drina River, where they were shot. Five of the seven men died as a
                    result of the shooting and two survived by falling into the river, pretending to be dead. This
                    incident is referred to as the Drina River incident.
                </p>
                <p id="p-v-47">

                    2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 29 November 2012, the Trial Chamber found the Appellant guilty, in
                    relation to the Drina River incident, as a co-perpetrator of persecution as a crime against humanity
                    pursuant to Article 5(h) of the Statute, for the murders of the five Muslim men and the inhumane
                    acts inflicted on the two surviving Muslim men (Count 3) and murder as a violation of the laws or
                    customs of war pursuant to Article 3 of the Statute, for the murder of the five Muslim men (Count
                    5). The Trial Chamber, however, acquitted the Appellant on the remaining counts, either because it
                    found the evidence to be insufficient or because the convictions would have been cumulative. For the
                    convictions on Counts 3 and 5, the Trial Chamber imposed a prison sentence of twenty years.
                </p>
                <p id="p-v-48">
                    3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Appellant is now appealing both the convictions and sentence. His
                    arguments, raising eight grounds of appeal, are spread out in two separate documents - the Defence
                    Appeal Brief and the Defence Additional Appeal Brief. The Appeals Chamber finds these arguments to
                    be repetitive and unstructured and has, therefore, regrouped them. An overview of the arguments of
                    the Appellant as set out in his submissions is found in the procedural background of these appellate
                    proceedings, set forth in Annex A.

                    4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Appeals Chamber finds it appropriate to recall the standard of review
                    by which the Appeals Chamber determines whether a ground of appeal is to be granted or dismissed,
                    and the related formal requirements.

                <p id="p-v-52">
                    5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On appeal, the parties must limit their arguments to legal errors
                    invalidating the decision and to factual errors occasioning a miscarriage of justice within the

The Appeals Chamber shall hear appeals from persons convicted by the Trial Chambers or from the Prosecutor on the following grounds: (a) an error on a question of law invalidating the decision; or (b) an error of fact which has occasioned a miscarriage of justice.  2. The Appeals Chamber may affirm, reverse or revise the decisions taken by the Trial Chambers.”   An exception to this general rule is when a party raises a legal issue that is of general significance to the International Tribunal’s jurisprudence.

                    do not support the contention, that party does not automatically lose its point since the Appeals
                    Chamber may step in and, for other reasons, find in favour of the contention that there is an error

                    has been defined as “a grossly unfair outcome in judicial proceedings, as when a defendant is

                    the
                    Appeals Chamber cannot identify the alleged error by the Trial Chamber; ii) arguments in relation to

The Prosecution submits that this argument raises a new ground of appeal not contained in the notice of appeal, although the Appellant did not seek leave to do so, and that it should accordingly be rejected on this ground, Prosecution Response Brief, para. 4.26.  With regard to the Prosecution’s argument that this raises a new ground of appeal, the Appeals Chamber finds that the Notice of Appeal refers to these paragraphs of the Judgement and to the fact that Serbs had been leaving until the arrival of the JNA (the U`ice Corps).  The Notice of Appeal states in the
relevant part that “[w]hen we deal with Findings of Facts to the general requirements under C (para 39-56 pages 2323-2329) the Defence has objections for certain conclusions and states that to the coming of U`ice Corps in Višegrad (to this event it came because of the occupation of hydro plant by Mural Sabanović and the threat that they would inflame the barrage and make a great catastrophe) Višegrad authority was kept by the Muslim majority and then the police of Serbian nationality was separated and till then the Serbs were those who had left Višegrad. The Defence states that during U`ice corps stay, around
19 May 1992, the state of security was not or less stable and that even after the departure of U`ice Corps it came to instability and various paramilitary actions.” The Appeals Chamber therefore finds that this is not a new ground of appeal.

                    no reasonable trier of fact could have made this finding. The question whether the Appellant acted
                    as an informant to the group or the exact nature of his relationship with the members of the group
                    is not the determining factor in establishing whether the acts of the Appellant were closely related
                    to the armed conflict. The Appellant does not dispute that the acts of the Milan Lukić group were
                    connected to the conflict. In fact, the acts for which the Appellant has been convicted were carried
                    out while he was together with the Milan Lukić group. The Appeals Chamber is of the view that the
                    Appellant was associated with the Milan Lukić group on that occasion and that this establishes a
                    sufficient nexus between the Appellant’s acts and the armed conflict. This sub-ground of appeal
                    therefore fails.

                    describe in detail what he was wearing at the time indicates that, had he been armed, the witness

                    Appellant considers that the only possible conclusion is that witness VG-32 invented the fact that

                                that he saw the Accused with an automatic rifle inside the lobby of the hotel. When

                    do not establish that no reasonable tribunal could have found, based on the testimony of witnesses
                    VG-14 and VG-32, that the Appellant was carrying an automatic rifle when he left the Vilina Vlas
                    Hotel. Both witnesses described the Appellant when he was in the lobby of the Vilina Vlas Hotel.
                    Witness VG-32 testified that the Appellant was unarmed in the hotel lobby: “[h]is arms were crossed,
                    and he was leaning against this little desk,” four or five metres from the reception area where the
                    witness was, which was unlit save for

                    However, witness VG-14 described the Appellant “in the

                    and given that the respective testimony does not show that the two witnesses looked at the Appellant

                    determining whether the Appellant was carrying a weapon in the hotel lobby at any one moment. In any
                    event, as stated by the Trial Chamber, both witnesses confirmed having seen the Appellant with a
                    weapon when he went to the vehicle after leaving the hotel. The alleged contradiction as to the type
                    of weapon described by witness VG-14 in his successive statements is not such that no reasonable
                    trier of fact could have found that the Appellant was armed with an automatic weapon when he left
                    the hotel.

                    no longer had a weapon. The Appellant states that when he left prison in early June he was assigned
                    to “town cleaning” which he carried out until 14 June 1992 when he fell off a horse and was taken to

                    witnesses in the months of May and June 1992 does not call into question the testimony of witnesses

                    armed when he left the Vilina Vlas Hotel on 7 June 1992. The Appellant could have obtained another

The Prosecution responds that the fact that witness VG-32 did not hear the Appellant talking while they were on the bank does not mean that he said nothing, Prosecution Response Brief, para. 2.14.  The question of knowing whether the shooting began immediately after this alleged exchange or after the co-perpetrators of the shooting spoke about whether to fire individually or in bursts, Defence Appeal Brief, paras 72-74.

                                knew that the men were not to be exchanged but were to be killed. The evidence of the
                                Accused himself was that he knew that Milan Lukić had committed serious crimes,
                                including killings, in the area of Višegrad shortly prior to the Drina River incident.
                                On the afternoon of 7 June 1992, during the drive from Višegrad to the Vilina Vlas
                                Hotel, he had been told by the man who had driven him there that Milan Lukić had, on
                                several occasions, taken out Muslim employees from the Varda Factory in order to
                                mistreat or kill them. The Trial Chamber rejects the Accused’s evidence that it was only
                                when Milan Lukić stopped the cars near Sase and ordered the seven men to walk towards
                                the bank of the Drina River that he understood that these men were not to be exchanged,

                    In spite of the use of the word “yes” by the Appellant, the Appeals Chamber is of the view that this
                    excerpt does not allow for a conclusion that the Appellant was told by Stanko Pecikoza about the
                    killings allegedly committed by Milan Lukić, since his statement, seen in context, was followed by
                    the expression “that he was causing problems.” Therefore, his prior statement (exhibit 15.1) does
                    not support a finding in relation to killings. The corresponding section of the testimony of the

                                were already taken away, but he sent his son and his brother and they managed to catch
                                up with the vehicle transporting them somewhere near Banja, and they took them off of
                                the vehicle, his son and his brother did. So again, they were lucky that he was on time.

                    The testimony of the Appellant is ambiguous given the use of the expression “I don’t know”. It is
                    unclear whether the Appellant was told about the discovery of the body of the young man Velagić by
                    Stanko Pecikoza in the car on the way to the hotel, or whether Stanko Pecikoza only expressed his
                    suspicion that Milan Lukić had killed Velagić. Furthermore, it must be noted that a certain Velagić
                    was, according to paragraph 15 of the Indictment, killed on 10 June by Milan Lukić at the Varda
                    factory. This fact renders the testimony of the Appellant even more unclear as to which killings he
                    was referring to.

                    the evidence in question does not support the Trial Chamber’s finding that Stanko Pecikoza told the
                    Appellant about any killings of workers from the Varda factory that would have taken place before 7
                    June 1992. Even if it were admitted that the Appellant had been told by Stanko Pecikoza that the
                    young man Velagić had been killed by Milan Lukić, this would still be insufficient to safely infer
                    that the Appellant knew when he left the hotel that the seven Muslim men were going to be killed and
                    not exchanged. Therefore, the Appeals Chamber finds that no reasonable trier of fact could have made
                    this finding, on the basis of the evidence. In this respect, the Appeals Chambers also takes into
                    consideration the following elements: i) the Appellant’s actions at the hotel as described by the
                    witnesses, including the fact that he had a weapon, do not by themselves reveal anything as to his
                    knowledge about the homicidal intent of Milan Lukić; ii) the version given by the Appellant that
                    Milan Lukić pretended at the time that the men were to be exchanged is consistent with the fact that
                    witness VG-32 testified that, while in the car on the way to Sase, he was told about the exchange by
                    one of the soldiers; iii) witness VG-32 testified that it was from the moment
                    Milan Lukić ordered them to leave the car that the behaviour of the soldiers changed drastically;<a

                                                                    class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover"

                                                                    data-content="See paras 33-45 above."><sup>93</sup></a>
                    Therefore, the issue to be considered at this stage is limited to whether it was reasonable of the
                    Trial Chamber to find that the Appellant pointed his gun at the seven Muslim men at the hotel in
                    paragraph 209 of the Judgement. This conclusion is not supported by the Trial Chamber’s
                    own finding in paragraph 100 of the Judgement where it found that “[o]ne of the unidentified armed
                    men guarded them [the seven Muslim men], pointing his automatic rifle at them, preventing any of
                    them from leaving the lobby of the hotel.” Further, the evidence presented at trial does not
                    support, as admitted by the Prosecution, a finding that the Appellant pointed his gun at the seven
                    Muslim men. The Appeals Chamber considers that no reasonable trier of fact could have found that the
                    Appellant pointed a gun at
                    the seven Muslim men at this stage. However, this finding was only one of several relating to the

                    actions of the Appellant from which the Trial Chamber inferred that the Appellant shared the intent
                    to
                    kill. It is therefore in the context of the alleged error relating to the mens rea of the Appellant
                    to kill the seven Muslim men that the Appeals Chamber will determine whether the error made by the
                    Trial Chamber, when it found that the Appellant pointed a gun at the men in the hotel, led to a
                    miscarriage of justice.<a id="p-v-272"   class="fn" tabindex="0"

                    pursuing his criminal purpose. The Prosecution considers that this is an irrelevant question since

                                [t]he Trial Chamber also rejects the evidence of the Accused that, in any event, he was
                                powerless to stop Milan Lukić from killing the Muslim men. VG-32 and VG-14 gave evidence
                                of their impression that throughout the entire incident there was no one around Milan
                                Lukić who could have affected him or his decisions and orders in a meaningful way.
                                However, the Accused’s claim of duress is inconsistent with the evidence that, one week
                                prior to the shooting at the Drina River and during the Musići incident, he had
                                successfully pleaded with Milan Lukić not to mistreat and harass the people in that
                                house. He asserted that he was the only person who could help on that occasion, and that
                                he had prevented the people living in that house from being mistreated and harassed by
                                Milan Lukić. The Trial Chamber has already rejected that claim, but the inconsistent
                                claims by the Accused as to his relationship with Milan Lukić has persuaded the Trial
                                Chamber that the Accused is prepared to give false versions of that relationship
                                according to the benefit he seeks to obtain at the time each version is given. <u> There
                                    was no other acceptable evidence that the Accused was under duress vis-à-vis Milan

                    Appellant’s relationship with

                    Milan Lukić’s group and, in particular, his role as an informant, the relevant findings are as
                    follows:

                                [t]he Trial Chamber is satisfied that the Accused did have some association with Milan
                                Lukić’s paramilitary group, but it is not satisfied that he was a member of that group
                                or that (except as otherwise stated) he participated directly in the crimes which that
                                group committed in Višegrad. The Trial Chamber is satisfied that Milan Lukić and most of
                                his associates had not lived in Višegrad for some time, and that they sought the
                                assistance of local Serbs to help them identify the targets of their crimes. <u>The
                                    Trial Chamber is satisfied that the Accused was acquainted with many members of the
                                    group prior to the events of 1992 and that, because of his close relationship with
                                    Milan Lukić, the Accused was a ready source of local information for the group about
                                    the location of Muslims in the area of Višegrad, and that he gave that information
                                    to the group with the full realisation that it would be used to persecute
                                    Muslims.</u> The Trial Chamber is not satisfied that that association is a
                                sufficient basis by itself for any finding that the Accused shared the general homicidal
                                intentions of that group.<a id="p-v-338"   class="fn"

                                To conclude, and as already stated, the Trial Chamber is not satisfied that the Accused
                                was a member of Milan Lukić’s paramilitary group, or that his association with that
                                group was such that it is possible to draw an inference beyond reasonable doubt that the
                                Accused shared the general homicidal intentions of that group. <u>The Trial Chamber is
                                    satisfied that he had some association with that group, in that he willingly acted
                                    as an informant to that group, and that this willingness arose from his close
                                    relationship with Milan Lukić.<a id="p-v-339"

                    71. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three pieces of evidence were cited by the Trial Chamber in support of
                    the challenged finding. The Trial Chamber relies on the fact that: First, Milan Lukić and his men,
                    who had not been living in the Višegrad area for some time, needed information on the Muslims living
                    in the area; second, the Appellant was acquainted with most of Milan Lukić’s associates and had a
                    close relationship with Milan Lukić himself; and, third, the Appellant was a ready source of
                    information about the location of Muslims in the area and he gave that information to the group with
                    the full realisation that it would be used to persecute Muslims. The first two of these three pieces
                    of evidence show that the group needed an informant and that the Appellant was able to fulfil that
                    role, but only the third piece of evidence demonstrates that the Appellant actually did so. It must
                    therefore be determined whether, as the Appellant claims, no reasonable trier of fact could to draw
                    the inference the Trial Chamber did based on the evidence available.

"><sup>127</sup></a> to suggest this conclusion is the testimony of witness VG-14 who testified that, while he was in

                    house and told Milan Lukić that it belonged to a Muslim
                    family. A reading of the relevant transcripts<a id="p-v-344"
                                                                    class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover"

The cars stopped in front of a house.  Mitar Vasiljević, as he was talking to Lukić, said that this was a Muslim house.  Q. When the cars stopped, what happened?  A. They ordered us to get out of the car and told us not to try to escape.”"><sup>128</sup></a>
                    shows that the Prosecution did not focus on this issue and that the witness’s remark was incidental.
                    It should also be noted that, during his testimony, the Appellant was invited by Judge Janu to
                    comment on the words attributed to him by witness VG-14. The Appellant denied that he had ever said
                    such a thing or that he had even been in the same car as witness VG-14 and he asserted that the
                    house in question belonged to a Serb.<a id="p-v-345"   class="fn"

Stojan is his first name.  Judge Janu: You know, I'm not familiar with the area, but the witness VG14 said when you stopped, you told to Milan Lukić that this is a Muslim house.  That is in his statement.  A. When the car stopped -- I couldn't have said that.  I wasn't with Milan in the car.  He said that in -- that there were six people in the Yugo.  Judge Janu: With him in the car -- you were not in the car with Milan Lukić?  A. I was in the Yugo, with Meho D`afić, the second car, another car.”  It should be noted that both witness VG-14, who was in the Passat, (T. 435), and witness VG-32, who was in the Yugo, (T. 272), stated that the
Appellant and Milan Lukić were in the Passat when they went from the hotel to Sase.

                                that the intent of Milan Lukić’s group was to persecute the local Muslim population of
                                Višegrad through the commission of the underlying crimes. The Trial Chamber is satisfied
                                that, in providing information to the group led by Milan Lukić, the Accused shared the
                                intention of that group to persecute the local Muslim civilians on religious or
                                political grounds. In order to convict the Accused for the crime of persecution,

                    sharing the intent of Milan Lukić and his men to persecute Muslim civilians “in general” and the
                    issue of his specific discriminatory intent with respect to the crimes for which he was found
                    guilty, i.e., the killing of five of the seven Muslim men at the Drina River and the inhumane acts
                    committed against the two survivors. With regard to the first point, the Trial Chamber relied on its
                    findings on the Appellant’s role as an informant.<a id="p-v-363"

                                evidence is that these seven Muslim men were singled out for religious or political
                                reasons, and that the killing of five of them were acts carried out on discriminatory

                    the view that the first finding is superfluous and that the Trial Chamber clearly believed that,
                    even if the Appellant had acted with discriminatory intent in providing information to the group,
                    this by itself did not prove that he had acted with discriminatory intent when he took part in the
                    Drina River incident. Contrary to the submissions of the Appellant, the Trial Chamber did not deduce
                    the discriminatory intent of the Appellant from the fact that he was an informant of the group. The
                    Trial Chamber affirmed that “the acts of the Accused were in fact discriminatory, in that the men
                    were killed only because they were

                    Muslim.”<a id="p-v-371"   class="fn" tabindex="0"

                    Indeed, no evidence seems to have been tendered which would indicate that the seven

                    Muslims were singled out for any other reason than their ethnicity.

                                [t]he Trial Chamber is satisfied that the Accused participated with Milan Lukić and
                                others in the searching of the house of VG-59’s father in Musići in late May 1992. The
                                Accused admitted that he was present during this incident and that he was armed. The
                                Trial Chamber accepts the version of events given of that incident by witnesses VG-59
                                and VG-55, notwithstanding the different account given by the Accused, which the Trial
                                Chamber rejects as an untruthful attempt to exculpate himself. The evidence of the
                                Accused did not cause the Trial Chamber to have any doubt as to the truth of the
                                evidence of these two witnesses. Both VG-59 and VG-55 knew the Accused from childhood,
                                and neither had any bias against him which would cause them to colour their testimony.
                                In fact, had they wanted to give false evidence against the Accused, they could have
                                exaggerated his role in the crimes committed against the people of Musići, which they
                                did not. They did not suggest that he was otherwise
                                involved in any criminal conduct. Indeed, the Accused gave evidence that, in his view,
                                VG-59’s and
                                VG-55’s evidence was accurate, despite the discrepancies between their account and his

                    84. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Appeals Chamber finds that the two witnesses’ accounts are
                    compatible. The transcripts show that witness VG-55 was at the house of VG-59’s father even before
                    the Appellant and the

                    paramilitary group arrived and that witness VG-59 and his wife and children were only taken later to
                    the house. It is therefore more than likely that when witness VG-59 arrived at the house with other
                    members of his family Milan Lukić had already completed the search described by witness VG-55 and
                    had come back outside, either to take part in assembling the other villagers who were then gathered
                    together at the house of witness VG-59’s father whilst the Appellant continued to stand watch, or to
                    search other houses. It should be noted that witness VG-59 provided no account of Milan Lukić’s
                    search of his
                    father's house, which was described in detail by witness VG-55.<a id="p-v-404"

                    However, the testimony of witness

                    VG-59 describes the fact that, while searches were carried out in the other houses in the village
                    and valuables were taken from these houses, the Appellant was standing guard in front of his
                    father’s house.

                    non-existent, minor or immaterial and that the Appellant has failed to show that no reasonable trier
                    of fact could rely on this evidence in reaching the finding that the Appellant was indeed standing
                    armed guard at the entrance to the house of witness VG-59’s father during the events there and
                    thereby participating in the search of the house. This sub-ground of appeal therefore fails.

                    86. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Appeals Chamber dismisses the Appellant’s alleged errors regarding:
                    i) the finding of fact that he was armed on 7 June 1992; ii) the finding of fact that he tried to
                    dissuade Milan Lukić from committing the crimes; iii) the finding of fact that the Appellant was
                    standing some distance away from the group during the shooting; iv) the finding of fact that
                    Appellant was an informant to the Milan Lukić group; and v) the finding of fact regarding the
                    Appellant’s role during the search in Musići. The Appeals Chamber finds that the Trial Chamber erred
                    when it found: i) that the Appellant knew at the Vilina Vlas Hotel that the seven Muslim men were
                    going to be killed; and ii) that the Appellant pointed his gun at the seven Muslim men whilst at the
                    hotel. The question of whether these errors led to a miscarriage of justice will be considered below

                    The Trial Chamber applied the established test for determining whether cumulative convictions are
                    permissible and found that persecution pursuant to Article 5(h) of the Statute requires the
                    materially distinct element of a discriminatory act and a discriminatory intent compared to the
                    crimes of murder and inhumane acts. Therefore a conviction was entered for persecution pursuant to
                    Article 5(h) of the Statute, but not for murder and inhumane acts pursuant to Article 5 of the
                    Statute. As a result, the Appellant was convicted for persecution as a crime against humanity under
                    Article 5 of the Statute (Count 3) and for murder under Article 3 of the Statute (Count 5).<a

principles on criminal responsibility laid down both in the Statute and general international criminal law and in national
legislation, warrant the conclusion that case law reflects customary rules of international criminal law.”  To reach this finding the Appeals Chamber interpreted the Statute on the basis of its purpose as set out in the report of the United Nations
Secretary-General to the Security Council, Report of the Secretary-General Pursuant to Paragraph 2 of Security CouncilResolution 808 (1993), U.N. Doc. S/25704, 3 May 1993.  It also considered the specific characteristics of many crimes perpetrated in war.  In order to determine the status of customary law in this area, it studied in detail the case-law relating to many war crimes cases tried after the Second World War (paras 197 et seq.).  It further considered the relevant provisions of two international Conventions which reflect the views of many States in legal matters (Article 2(3)(c) of the International Convention for  the Suppression of Terrorist Bombings, adopted by a consensus vote by the General Assembly in  its resolution 52/164 of 15 December 1997 and opened for signature on 9 January 1998; Article 25 of the Statute of the International Criminal Court, adopted on 17 July 1998 by the Diplomatic Conference of Plenipotentiaries held in Rome) (paras 221-222).  Moreover, the Appeals Chamber referred to national legislation and case-law stating that it was a matter of specifying that the notion of “common purpose,” established in international criminal law, has foundations in many national systems, while asserting that it was not established that most, if not all of the countries, have the same notion of common purpose (paras 224-225).  The Tadić Appeals Chamber used interchangeably the expressions “joint criminal enterprise,” “common purpose” and “criminal enterprise,” although the concept is generally referred to as “joint criminal enterprise,” and this is the term used by the parties in the present appeal.

                    An example is a plan formulated by the participants in the joint criminal enterprise to kill where,

                    an act which, while outside the common purpose, is nevertheless a natural and foreseeable

                    While murder may not have been explicitly acknowledged to be part of the common purpose, it was

                    Second, the existence of a common purpose which amounts to or involves the commission of a crime
                    provided for in the Statute is required. There is no necessity for this purpose to have been
                    previously arranged or formulated. It may materialise extemporaneously and be inferred from the

                    - With regard to the basic form of joint criminal enterprise what is required is the intent to

intent to participate in a systemic form of joint criminal enterprise, the Trial Chamber went beyond the criterion set by the
Appeals Chamber in the Tadić case.  Since the Trial Chamber’s findings showed that the system in place at the KP Dom sought to subject non-Serb detainees to inhumane living conditions and ill-treatment on discriminatory grounds, the Trial Chamber should have examined whether or not Krnojelac knew of the system and agreed to it, without it being necessary to establish that he had entered into an agreement with the guards and soldiers - the principal perpetrators of the crimes committed under the system - to commit those crimes.”"><sup>177</sup></a>

                </h3>
                <p id="p-v-463">
                    102.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Participation in a joint criminal enterprise is a form of “commission”
                    under Article 7(1) of the Statute.
                    The participant therein is liable as a co-perpetrator of the crime(s).
                    Aiding and abetting the commission of a crime is usually considered to incur a lesser degree of
                    individual criminal responsibility than committing a crime.
                    In the context of a crime committed by several co-perpetrators in a joint criminal enterprise,
                    the aider and abettor is always an accessory to these co-perpetrators, although the co- perpetrators
                    may not even know of the aider and abettor’s contribution.
                    Differences exist in relation to the actus reus as well as to the mens rea requirements between both
                    forms of individual criminal responsibility:
                </p>
                <p>
                    (i)The aider and abettor carries out acts specifically directed to assist, encourage or lend moral
                    support to the perpetration of a certain specific crime (
                    murder, extermination, rape, torture, wanton destruction of civilian property, etc.), and this

                    By contrast, it is sufficient for a participant in a joint criminal enterprise to perform acts that

                                inhumane acts and violence to life and person. At the Pre-Trial Conference on 20 July
                                2001, the Prosecution was asked to state clearly what
                                it meant by the use of the term “in concert”. The Prosecution initially stated that all
                                it was trying to convey was that the
                                Accused was not acting alone and that he did not commit the crimes by himself, but it
                                was eventually agreed that the Prosecution was relying upon a joint criminal enterprise.

                    first category is relevant.
                    The Appellant alleges three errors of law related to the concept of joint criminal enterprise.
                    According to the first alleged error, the Trial Chamber failed to explicitly indicate which exact
                    criteria it applied to assess the existence of a joint criminal enterprise.
                    The Appeals Chamber recalls that paragraphs 63 to 69 of the Judgement clearly set out the
                    Prosecution’s case as well as the applicable law.
                    Furthermore, contrary to the Appellant’s submission, paragraphs 206 to 211, as well as paragraphs
                    238 to 240 of the Judgement clearly indicate the criteria the
                    Trial Chamber applied in order to determine whether the Appellant participated in a joint criminal
                    enterprise to murder the seven Muslim men.
                    Therefore, the Appeals Chamber finds that the Appellant’s submission is not well founded. This

                    He was armed in the hotel and thereby assisted in preventing the seven Muslim men from fleeing.

                    that he was not armed on 7 June 1992
                    and the fact that he was standing at a distance away from the group during the shooting.
                    The Appeals Chamber has also dismissed the claim by the Appellant that the Trial Chamber erred by
                    not believing that he tried to prevent Milan Lukić from committing the murders.
                    The Appeals Chamber notes that the Trial Chamber does not refer to this element in paragraph 209 of
                    the Judgement when it lists the Appellant’s actions relied on to infer his intent.

                    129.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The actions of the Appellant from the moment the cars stopped in Sase,
                    upon which the Trial Chamber relied to infer that he intended that the seven Muslim men to be
                    killed,
                    are the following: While Milan Lukić, the two unidentified men and the Appellant escorted the seven
                    Muslim men to the bank of the Drina River,
                    the Appellant pointed a gun at them to prevent their escape.
                    Then, the Appellant stood behind the seven Muslim men with his gun shortly before the shooting
                    occurred.
                    The Trial Chamber did not find, however, that the Appellant acted at the same level of authority or
                    with the same degree of control over the killings as the other three actors.
                    To the contrary, the Trial Chamber stated that it is “is not satisfied that the Prosecution has
                    established beyond reasonable doubt
                    that the Accused fired his weapon at the same time as the other three, or that he personally killed
                    anyone or more of the victims”.

                    i) the overall context of the Drina River incident;
                    ii) the previous association of the Appellant with the Milan Lukić group at Musići as well as at the
                    Vilina Vlas Hotel, although he was not found to be a member of the group;
                    iii) the Appellant’s participation with Milan Lukić and others in searching the house of witness

                    iv) the fact that Milan Lukić and the two unidentified men forcibly detained the seven Muslim men;
                    the Appellant, who was armed in the hotel,
                    thereby assisted in preventing the seven Muslim men from fleeing from the hotel;
                    v) the fact that the Appellant did not know until the car stopped in Sase that the seven Muslim men
                    were to be killed;
                    vi) the behaviour of the soldiers changed drastically from the moment Milan Lukić ordered them to

                    131.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Appeals Chamber recalls that the question before it is whether no
                    reasonable tribunal could find
                    that the only reasonable inference available on the evidence cited above was that the Appellant
                    shared the intent to commit murder.
                    The Appeals Chamber considers that when a Chamber is confronted with the task of determining
                    whether it can infer from the acts of an accused that he or she shared the intent to commit a crime,
                    special attention must be paid to whether these acts are ambiguous, allowing for several reasonable
                    inferences.
                    The Appeals Chamber is satisfied that no reasonable tribunal could have found that the only
                    reasonable inference available on the evidence,
                    as cited above, is that the Appellant had the intent to kill the seven Muslim men.
                    The Trial Chamber found that the Appellant assisted Milan Lukić and his men by preventing the seven
                    Muslim men from fleeing.

	with a gun in the middle of a semi-circle that Serbs had formed around a group of Muslims who were then shot."><sup>222</sup></a>
                    It did not find, however, that the Appellant shot at the Muslim men himself, nor that he exercised
                    control over the firing.
                    Compared to the involvement of Milan Lukić and potentially one or both of the other men,
                    the participation of the Appellant in the overall course of the killings did not reach the same
                    level.
                    The above-mentioned acts of the Appellant were ambiguous as to whether or not the Appellant intended
                    that the seven Muslim men be killed.
                    This conclusion is further supported by the relatively short period of time between the change of
                    attitude of Milan Lukić and the shooting,
                    the strong personality of Milan Lukić compared to the Appellant, as well as the factors mentioned in
                    paragraph 130.
                    The Appeals Chamber, therefore, concludes that the Trial Chamber erred by finding that the only
                    reasonable inference
                    from the evidence was that the Appellant shared the intent to kill the seven Muslim men.

                    the Appellant would not be responsible as a co-perpetrator in the joint criminal enterprise.
                    The Appeals Chamber will now consider whether the Appellant is, nevertheless, responsible as an
                    aider and abettor.

                    that the only reasonable inference from the evidence was that the Appellant shared the intent to
                    kill the seven Muslim men.
                    The Appellant argues under his fourth ground of appeal that his actions do not in fact amount to
                    aiding and abetting, as he did not facilitate the commission of the crime.
                    He submits that Milan Lukić and the two unidentified men did not need any help from the Appellant at
                    the Vilina Vlas Hotel or at the Drina River,

                    The Appellant infers from this that it would not be logical to conclude that Milan Lukić
                    and his men needed the assistance of the Appellant at the Vilina Vlas Hotel or at the Drina River as
                    the risk that the seven Muslim men might resist was less important at this stage.

                    134.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Appeals Chamber has already found that the Appellant knew that the
                    seven Muslim men were to be killed;
                    that he walked armed with the group from the place where they had parked the cars to the Drina

                    that he pointed his gun at the seven Muslim men;
                    and that he stood behind the Muslim men with his gun together with the other three offenders shortly
                    before the shooting started.
                    The Appeals Chamber believes that the only reasonable inference available on the totality of
                    evidence is that the Appellant knew that his acts would assist the commission of the murders.
                    The Appeals Chamber finds that in preventing the men from escaping on the way to the river bank and
                    during the shooting,
                    the Appellant’s actions had a “substantial effect upon the perpetration of the crime.”

                    of the murders and the inhumane acts and his support had a substantial effect upon the perpetration
                    of the crimes.
                    The Appeals Chamber therefore finds the Appellant guilty for aiding and abetting murder pursuant to
                    Article 3 of the Statute (Count 5).
                    Further, the Appeals Chamber finds the Appellant guilty as an aider and abettor for murder as a

                    According to the Prosecution, there is no reason “why a relevant discriminatory intent cannot be

                    the particular act or omission must also have discriminatory consequences.
                    The Appellant cannot be found responsible for the discriminatory consequences of the persecution as

                    Contrary to the submissions of the Appellant, the Trial Chamber made it clear in paragraph 251 of

                    that regardless of whether or not the Appellant was an informant, or whether or not he shared the

                    the Prosecution has to establish that the Accused participated in the commission of a persecutory
                    act with a discriminatory intention.

                    In order to convict him for aiding and abetting the crime of persecution, the Appeals Chamber must
                    establish that the Appellant

                    the underlying crimes,
                    and by their acts they intended to discriminate against the Muslim population, and that, with that

                    the Appellant made a substantial contribution to the commission of the discriminatory acts by the

                    it is beyond doubt that the acts committed by Milan Lukić and the two other men amount to the crime
                    of persecution:
                    They killed the five Muslim men and committed inhumane acts against the two survivors with the
                    deliberate intent to discriminate on religious or political grounds.
                    Furthermore, the Appeals Chamber concurs with the findings of the Trial Chamber that the Appellant
                    participated in the
                    Drina River incident “with full awareness that the intent of the Milan Lukić’s group was to
                    persecute the local
                    Muslim population of Višegrad through the commission of the underlying crimes.”

                    The only reason why the seven Muslim men were arrested and killed was because of their belonging to
                    the Muslim population of Višegrad.
                    The Appellant was aware of these facts and he willingly participated in the Drina River incident by
                    pointing his gun at the victims and preventing them from fleeing.
                    Even if it has not been established beyond reasonable doubt that he personally killed the five
                    Muslim men,
                    his support had a substantial effect upon the perpetration of the crimes on the bank of the Drina
                    River.
                    He was at that time fully aware that his participation assisted the commission of the crime of
                    persecution by the principal perpetrators.
                    The Appellant is therefore responsible for having aided and abetted the crime of persecution by way
                    of murder of the five Muslim men and of inhumane acts against the two other Muslim men (Count 3).
                    The finding that the Appellant is responsible for aiding and abetting persecution has an impact on
                    other
                    crimes for which he is found responsible, and the cumulative conviction is discussed below.

                    Article 5

                    Article 5.
                    On the other hand, Article 5 requires proof that the act occurred as part of a widespread or

                    civilian population; that element is not required by Article 3.”

                <p id="p-v-679"> 171.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When discussing the sentence, the Trial Chamber found that
                    a discriminatory state of mind may constitute an aggravating factor when it is not an element of the
                    crime in question. In paragraph 277 of the Judgement, the Trial Chamber held that a discriminatory
                    state of mind is an element of the crime of persecution pursuant to Article 5(h) of the Statute and
                    “may not additionally aggravate that offence.” In paragraph 278, however, the Trial Chamber held
                    that a discriminatory state of mind may be used in aggravation in relation to offences for which it
                    is not required as an element and accepted that, in relation to the conviction for murder pursuant
                    to Article 3 of the Statute, the Appellant’s discriminatory state of mind does constitute an

                <p id="p-v-680"> 172.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several questions arise before the Appeals Chamber. The
                    first issue is whether discriminatory intent can be used as an aggravating factor. To that question
                    the answer is in the affirmative. The Appeals Chamber has already held in the Kunarac Appeals

                            it is alleged that the Trial Chamber erred in regarding the discriminatory objective as an
                            aggravating factor, as this constitutes an element of Article 5 crimes. In this context, the
                            Appeals Chamber recalls the Tadić Appeal Judgement, which states that a discriminatory
                            intent “is an indispensable legal ingredient of the offence only with regards to those
                            crimes for which this is expressly required, that is, for Article 5(h) of the Statute,
                            concerning various types of persecution.” It is not an element for other offences enumerated
                            in Article 5 of the Statute.<a id="p-v-684"   class="fn"

                    every conviction should stand on its own. Consequently, aggravating circumstances must be considered
                    for every crime separately. As discriminatory intent is an aggravating circumstance for the war

                    A discriminatory state of mind is not an element of the crime of murder under Article 3 of the

                    murder. It could however be taken into account in estimating the gravity of the murder. This is the
                    way the Trial Chamber used it. The discriminatory state of mind was used once in order to assess the
                    gravity of the crime of murder and, of course on another occasion, in order to

                    In the Trial Chamber’s finding that the Appellant did not show any remorse for his participation in
                    the Drina River incident, the Appeals Chamber understands that the Trial Chamber exercised its own
                    discretion in deciding that the words used by the Appellant did not show real remorse and could not
                    therefore be considered as a mitigating circumstance. The Appellant has not shown that the Trial
                    Chamber committed any error in the exercise of its discretion. </p>

                    incident, he went to the police to report the killings. The view of the Appeals Chamber is that, in

                <p id="p-v-712"> 181.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Trial Chamber imposed a prison sentence of twenty years
                    on the Appellant. The Appeals Chamber has not found in favour of any of the Appellant’s alleged
                    errors in relation to the sentence. However, the Appeals Chamber is of the view that the sentence
                    needs to be adjusted due to the Appeals Chamber’s finding that the Appellant was responsible as an
                    aider and abettor with respect to murder as a violation of the laws or customs of war under Article
                    3 of the Statute (Count 5) and persecution by way of murder and inhumane acts as a crime against
                    humanity pursuant to Article 5(h) of the Statute (Count 3), instead of being responsible as a
                    co-perpetrator as was found by the Trial Chamber. The Appeals Chamber considers that it has the

                    serious crimes. Therefore, taking into account the particular circumstances of this case as well as
                    the form and degree of the participation of the Appellant in the crimes, the Appeals Chamber finds
                    that a sentence of

                <p id="p-v-734"> 1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seven men were lined up on the bank of the Drina River; they
                    were made to face the river; they were unarmed civilians. Then, five to six metres behind them,
                    another group lined up; it was armed; it included the appellant. This group shot in the direction of
                    the seven men. Five of these were killed; they fell into the river. Pretending to have been shot,
                    the two others also fell into the river; they lived to tell the tale. </p>


                <p id="p-v-735"> 2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Trial Chamber was not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt
                    that the appellant himself had killed anyone. Nevertheless, on the theory of joint criminal
                    enterprise, it convicted him of murder as a co- perpetrator. </p>


                <p id="p-v-736"> 3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with the Appeals Chamber that the appellant had
                    criminal responsibility. Where I differ is on the question of the level of that responsibility. The
                    Appeals Chamber substitutes a conviction for aiding and abetting murder for the conviction for
                    murder as a co-perpetrator which was imposed by the Trial Chamber. The Trial Chamber’s conviction
                    for persecution, as a co-perpetrator, through murder of the five victims and inhumane acts inflicted
                    on the remaining two has likewise been revised to one of aiding and abetting persecution. </p>

                <p id="p-v-739"> 5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the territory concerned, ethnic cleansing was in progress.
                    In the context of that phenomenon, an attack took place in the municipality of Višegrad. In the
                    words of the Trial Chamber:

                        The attack took many forms, starting with the Serb take-over of the town and the systematic and
                        large-scale criminal campaign of murders, rapes and mistreatment of the non-Serb population of
                        this municipality, particularly the Muslims, which eventually culminated in one of the most
                        comprehensive and ruthless campaigns of ethnic cleansing in the Bosnian conflict. Within a few
                        weeks, the municipality of Višegrad was almost completely cleansed of its non-Serb citizens,

                    two motor cars to Vilina Vlas Hotel in Višegradska Banja. That hotel was accepted by the parties as
                    the headquarters of Lukić’s paramilitary group. Throughout the entire incident involved in this case
                    Lukić carried a sniper rifle with a silencer, while the two other men each carried an automatic

                    Eventually, on his orders, the group (including the appellant) entered the cars. After a short

                <p id="p-v-760"> 11.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The appellant’s case is that, until the cars arrived at

                    stopped at Sase, he realised that this was not to be – that the men were to be killed. The Trial
                    Chamber found against that claim to late discovery of the true purpose in view. It said that it was
                    “satisfied that, when the Accused left the Vilina Vlas Hotel, he knew that the men were not to be

                    The Appeals Chamber disagrees; it states that it would not be reasonable to conclude “that the

                    witness VG-32 testified that it was from the moment Milan Lukić ordered them to leave the car [i.e.,
                    at Sase] that the behaviour of the

                    The reference to “the soldiers” was a reference to the captors, including
                    the appellant. I understand that excerpt to mean that the Appeals Chamber considered that the
                    appellant did not expect that change. So, the evidence may be consulted. The Appeals Chamber refers
                    to the


                    evidence of witness VG-32 in footnote 220 of its judgment. As recorded in the transcript of the

                    Chamber, at p. 274, the evidence of that witness reads:

                        A … We stopped behind them [i.e., the other car] and we were ordered to go out. The moment we
                        got out – at the moment we got out and stood in the road, on the left-hand side, the behaviour
                        of the soldier changed drastically.
                        <br><br>

                        Q. You just referred to a soldier whose behaviour changed drastically. Which soldier are you

                        A. I said that the soldier who was sitting in the car as we were driving back from the hotel
                        offered us cigarettes. He talked to us very nicely. But the moment we got out of the car, they
                        stepped back. They moved a few metres to the side, and their weapons were on the ready, and they
                        spoke to us very harshly. They used very harsh words to order us to walk in the direction of the
                        river.
                        <br><br>
                        Q. I want to ask you – you said they had their weapons “on the ready.” What exactly do you mean
                        by that?
                        <br><br>

                <p id="p-v-767"> 13.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On allegedly learning for the first time at Sase that the
                    men were to be killed, the appellant did not protest or in any other way demonstrate surprise or
                    dissatisfaction. Asked, in effect, “whose behaviour changed drastically,” the witness replied: “I
                    meant everybody. I meant all four of them, actually, who were present there.” That included the
                    appellant; so he changed his behaviour too. He was fully identified with the other members of the
                    captor group; he was not, as the captives were, an unprepared spectator of the change. Certainly,
                    the previous behaviour of the captors appeared to have changed, and that apparent change in
                    behaviour could indeed have taken the captives by surprise, but not the appellant. </p>

                <p id="p-v-768"> 14.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An obvious reflection – not requiring evidence – is that,
                    for ease of security, the captors would not tell the captives of their impending doom while the cars
                    were on the move. However, the real purpose of their mission would of necessity be laid bare when
                    they reached the killing field. So, the fact that the captives were earlier told that they were
                    being taken to be exchanged did not reasonably imply that the appellant himself believed that or
                    that he was taken by surprise by the contrary disclosure at the killing field. There is no
                    suggestion that at that point his conduct differed from that of his colleagues. His actions were
                    those of a killer who knew all along what fate would befall the captives. </p>


                <p id="p-v-769"> 15.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In effect, the fact that the appellant did not show any
                    surprise in reaction to the disclosure at Sase that the captives were to be killed can be taken into
                    account in determining whether a reasonable tribunal of fact could have found, as the Trial Chamber
                    did, that before the cars arrived at Sase the appellant knew that the intention was to kill the
                    captives. Thus, even if an inference to this effect cannot be grounded on the particular matter

                    the appellant’s behaviour at Sase was itself material which justified that finding by the Trial

                    undermined the finding of the Trial Chamber; in my view, the transcript supports the finding of the
                    Trial Chamber and has to be considered by the Appeals Chamber. Evidence before a Trial Chamber is
                    notoriously voluminous: a Trial Chamber cannot be expected to refer to all of it. It is good law
                    that the Appeals Chamber has to presume that all relevant evidence was taken into consideration by
                    the Trial Chamber even if not expressly referred to by it.<a id="p-v-772"

See and consider R. v. London Borough of Brent B.C., ex parte Barisse (1999), 31 HLR 50 at 58. There is nothing particularly startling about the particular piece of evidence in this case, more especially as, on my interpretation, it coincides with the conclusion reached by the Trial Chamber."><sup>308</sup></a>

                <p id="p-v-776"> 17.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any event, as the Appeals Chamber recalls, at the time
                    when the cars parked at Sase, “the Appellant admits that he knew that the seven Muslim men were to

                    Thus, if he did not know of the intent before, he knew of it then. Did he also share the intent? The
                    shortness of time which elapsed between the arrival at Sase and the killing on the bank of the Drina
                    River is not decisive. What is decisive is the evidence of what happened between the arrival at Sase
                    and the time when the killings took place. </p>


                <p id="p-v-778"> 18.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this respect, paragraph 104 of the judgment of the Trial

                        [T]he seven Muslim men were instructed to get out of the cars and ordered by Milan Lukić to walk
                        through a field towards the bank of the Drina River, which was 100 metres away. The Trial
                        Chamber is satisfied that they were forced to walk at gunpoint towards the River. The Trial
                        Chamber is satisfied that the seven Muslim men were told that they would be killed if they tried
                        to escape.

                    to the river bank, his gun pointed at the captives with its safety catches off. Since he now knew
                    that the captives were to be killed, he could not claim that he was barring escape to ensure
                    availability for exchange. He was demonstrating willingness to participate in the imminent act of

                    told by an accused for reasons which do not necessarily imply guilt, it is a forbidden line of
                    reasoning that the telling of lies demonstrates guilt.<a id="p-v-811"

                    But that reasoning may be employed where the court is satisfied that the lies (whether told in court

                    of court) were told from a consciousness of guilt, provided they are not the only basis of
                    conviction. In my opinion, the lies told by the appellant fall into this category. They show that he

                    his criminal responsibility as one of the main actors; they therefore imply an acknowledgment of
                    that responsibility. The responsibility of a main actor which was thus acknowledged was that of a
                    co- perpetrator – and not that of a lesser actor such as an aider and abettor. </p>

                        112. The Trial Chamber is not satisfied that the Prosecution has established beyond reasonable
                        doubt that the Accused fired his weapon at the same time as the other three, or that he
                        personally killed anyone or more of the victims. VG-32 gave evidence that, immediately before
                        the shooting started, he heard three clicks, which were produced by the specific devices of the
                        automatic rifles of the Accused and the two other unidentified men. VG-32 said that, by
                        adjusting those devices, the method of shooting was adjusted from bursts of gunfire to
                        individual shots. Milan Lukić’s sniper rifle did not have such device. VG-14 gave evidence that
                        the first sequence of shots consisted of three loud shots and one “bluff” or muted shot. He
                        specified that the three loud shots came from the automatic rifles of the Accused and of the
                        other two unidentified men, and that the “bluff” shot came from Milan Lukić’s sniper rifle,
                        which had a silencer. Because of the extraordinarily tense situation in which they were at the
                        time, the evidence given by VG-32 and VG-14 that they remembered the number of shots fired is
                        not sufficiently reliable to base a finding beyond reasonable doubt on that evidence only that
                        the Accused actually pulled the trigger. Even the most honest witnesses can convince themselves
                        of what must have happened by a perfectly natural process of unconscious reconstruction. The
                        Trial Chamber accepts that these two witnesses honestly believed that this is what happened, but
                        it cannot exclude the very understandable and natural possibility that they have unconsciously
                        reconstructed it.
                        <br><br>
                        113. Although the Trial Chamber is not satisfied that it has been established that the Accused
                        actually killed anyone or more of the victims, it is nevertheless satisfied that the only
                        reasonable inference available on the evidence is that the Accused, by his actions, intended
                        that the seven Muslim men be killed, whether or not he actually carried out any of those
                        killings himself. One member of the Trial Chamber accepts the evidence relating to the number of
                        clicks, although this

                        evidence is not regarded by that Judge as essential or necessary to the determination of the
                        accused’s intention. The majority has no doubt that VG-32 honestly believed that he heard three
                        clicks, but the majority is not satisfied that there is no element of perfectly natural
                        reconstruction involved in that belief. The majority of the Trial Chambers makes an identical
                        finding in relation to the evidence of VG-14 concerning the number of shots and the nature of
                        the noise produced by the weapons being fired. The conclusion of all three members of the Trial
                        Chamber in relation to the intent of the Accused that those seven men be killed is thus
                        identical.

                    applicable to the accused: it could apply to any of the offenders. The holding reflected the simple
                    fact that it is evidentially difficult – although not impossible
                    - to establish that a particular member of a firing party actually pulled his trigger or that, if he

                    As I understand it, his submission is this: The doctrine of joint criminal enterprise is accepted.

                    found that his participation was substantial. Substantial participation means that the person must

                    shown to be “in a position with power to prevent the work of the joint criminal enterprise and the

                    argument. The leading principle, as recognised in Tadić, is that “the foundation of criminal
                    responsibility is the principle of personal culpability.”<a id="p-v-828"
                                                                                 class="fn"

                    An accused does not engage criminal responsibility as the perpetrator of a crime unless he was in
                    control of the commission of the crime. A person is in control of the commission of a joint criminal
                    enterprise crime only if his contribution was indispensable to its commission, in the sense that
                    non-fulfilment of his part of the enterprise would have ruined the efforts of his colleagues to
                    commit the crime.<a id="p-v-829"   class="fn" tabindex="0"

The famous Sirius case in Germany shows the excesses resulting from a subjective approach. In contrast, there is the more objective approach of the control theory. As it is put in Nigel Foster and Satish Sule, German Legal System and Laws, 3rd ed. (Oxford,
2002), at p. 331, “Control over the crime may  arise from  …, in cases of jointly  committed offences, control over a contributing act that is necessarily causal for commission of the crime.” That is to say, if the contribution is not made, the joint offence cannot be committed; thus the contributing offender has control over the joint offence."><sup>337</sup></a>
                    If he is regarded as culpable as a co-perpetrator of the crime although it could have been committed
                    without his participation in that sense, this can only be because his culpability as a co-
                    perpetrator derives from that of the real actor: the culpability of the latter as a perpetrator is
                    being imputed to the former. That is not the same as saying that an accused should only be culpable
                    for what he himself has done.<a id="p-v-830"   class="fn" tabindex="0"

                <p id="p-v-831"> 30.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tadić goes beyond that argument, for there the Appeals

                    it was not necessary to show that the defendant’s participation was a sine qua non, “or that the

                    So, if Tadić is wrong on that point, it could be argued that the appellant in this case was not in
                    control of the commission of the crime of murder because the actual killing was done by others and
                    his non-contribution did not ruin their efforts to commit the crime. More specifically, the
                    appellant


                    claimed that the power to make decisions rested with Lukić and that he was incapable of influencing
                    Lukić. Thus, the appellant lacked power to prevent the commission of the crime by his colleagues.
                    The result is that he was not guilty, as co-perpetrator, of the murder committed by them. </p>


                <p id="p-v-833"> 31.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not a case in which it is said that the act was the
                    act of the appellant because it was done on his behalf by an innocent agent used as his instrument.
                    It is therefore not necessary to consider the matter from the point of view appropriate to a
                    situation in which it turns out that the allegedly “innocent” agent himself intended the crime – a
                    situation in which the accused might be held to be guilty only as an aider and abettor.<a

                    Here, what is said is that the appellant was a party to a joint criminal enterprise to commit the
                    crime. One party to such an enterprise is not acting as the agent of another – at least, not in the
                    ordinary sense. All the parties are acting together to achieve an agreed result. In acting together,
                    they are really acting as one. On this basis, the acts of each are the acts of all. </p>


                <p id="p-v-835"> 32.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Transposing this model to this case, one may say that the
                    other offenders acted pursuant to an understanding to which the appellant was an active party at the
                    time of the commission of the act. In performing the act, they were of course carrying out their own
                    will, but they were also carrying out his will under that understanding. The perspective is
                    important. The focus is not on whether he had power to prevent them from acting as they did; the
                    focus is on whether, even if he could not prevent them from acting as they did, he could have
                    withheld his will and thereby prevented their act from being regarded as having been done pursuant
                    to his own will also. </p>


                <p id="p-v-836"> 33.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Participation has of course to be real; courts can determine
                    whether it is. What gives rise to difficulty is the proposition that a person must be shown to have
                    had power to prevent the activity of a joint criminal enterprise from being accomplished before he
                    can be held to have been a real participant in the enterprise. He might have been playing a
                    subordinate role in the enterprise and might have had no power to prevent its activity from being
                    accomplished; he could still have been participating. Examples could be easily found. The degree of
                    participation goes to sentence, not to guilt. </p>


                <p id="p-v-837"> 34.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In sum, even if Lukić’s personality was the dominant one, it

                    The appellant exercised his will when he joined the joint criminal enterprise led by Lukić, whom he
                    had previously known. Under the joint criminal enterprise, his colleagues were acting pursuant to
                    his will, as well as their own, when they committed the crime; thereupon, the crime became his crime
                    also. Accordingly, his conviction as a co-perpetrator of the murders committed by them satisfied the
                    leading principle that “the foundation of criminal responsibility is the principle of personal

                    said that it “rejects the evidence of the Accused that, in any event, he was powerless to stop Milan

                    positions. There were also some Serbian guards; their position was designed to prevent the Muslims
                    from fleeing and to make it possible to kill them.<a id="p-v-847"

                    The guards formed a semicircle; the appellant was somewhere in the middle of the semicircle. He was
                    holding his weapon with both hands in front of his chest like the rest of the guards. The 14
                    Muslim captives were killed. The killing was done by a certain man and by the military police. There
                    was no proof that the killing was done by the guards (including the appellant). The appellant was
                    held to be an aider and abettor, and not a co-perpetrator. The judgment said: </p>

                        When assessing the overall circumstances, the senate was unable to determine whether the
                        accused’s connection to the killing was so close that his contribution might be considered to be
                        a part of the killing and conversely whether the killing might be considered a consequence of

                <p id="p-v-851"> 38.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, the contrast is between whether the accused’s connection
                    with the killing was so close that his contribution might be considered to be part of the killing
                    and whether the killing might be considered a consequence of the accused’s part in the crime. That
                    is, with respect, a helpful formula. In opting for the lesser conviction, the court said: </p>

                        The extent of his objective participation in the overall course of the killings was slight.
                        Through his co-operation in the semi-circle of guards, he objectively reduced the defenceless
                        victims’ chance of escaping. However, the accused had no control over the killings, begun by
                        Lazarević and carried out by several marksmen. There were no sure indications either that the
                        accused at least intended to participate in the killings.<a id="p-v-854"

                <p id="p-v-855"> 39.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that case, there were “no sure indications” of intent to
                    participate in the killings. I apprehend that the reason for this is that, inter alia, the court
                    found that, even though he did eventually join the Serbs in the semicircle which was taking shape,
                    “the accused … hung back somewhat when the group of Muslims and the guards walked onto the bridge …”<a

                    guard the victims to ensure that they were killed by others. In the instant case, the accused
                    guarded the victims but he also took his position with the killers. In standing armed with the
                    killers drawn up in a line at the time of the shooting, and in allowing it to be thought that to all
                    intents and purposes he was one of them, he was demonstrating his willingness to participate in the
                    act of killing rather than his indifference as to whether that act was in

                <p id="p-v-868"> 43.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The real reason why the Appeals Chamber overturned the
                    persecution conviction was that the offences on which it was founded could not be made out because,
                    in the view of the Appeals Chamber, there was lack of proof of intent to kill. This is mentioned in
                    paragraph 141 of the judgment of the Appeals Chamber which states that in “the absence of this
                    intent [to kill], no reasonable trier of fact could have found the Appellant responsible for
                    committing the crime of persecution by murders and inhumane acts as a co-perpetrator to the joint
                    criminal enterprise.” </p>


                <p id="p-v-869"> 44.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, the judgment of the Appeals Chamber on persecution is
                    a sequel to its judgment on murders and inhumane acts: the appellant was not guilty of persecution
                    through offences which could not be proved for want of proof of intent to kill. My opinion being
                    that the appellant had the intent to kill and was thus guilty of those offences, it follows that the
                    conviction for persecution as handed down by
                    the Trial Chamber stands. </p>

                    it has been demonstrated that no reasonable tribunal of fact could have assessed the relevant
                    evidence differently from the way in which the Trial Chamber assessed it. I would accordingly affirm
                    the judgment of the Trial Chamber that, both on murder and on persecution, the criminal

                <p id="p-v-901"> 192.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Appellant has advanced the following eight grounds of
                    appeal against the Trial Chamber’s </p>

                    incident. The Appellant submits that the Trial Chamber erred in fact when it concluded that although
                    it was not satisfied that the Appellant actually killed one or more of the victims, it was
                    nevertheless convinced that the only reasonable inference available on the evidence was that the
                    Appellant intended, by his actions, that the seven Muslim men be killed, regardless of whether he
                    carried out any of the murders himself.<a id="p-v-904"   class="fn"

                    The Appellant raises three arguments in support of this ground of appeal: i) that he was not armed
                    on the day of the facts; ii) that he was not aware of the homicidal intent of Milan Lukić and his
                    men before they took the seven Muslim men by force to the bank of the Drina River, where he
                    attempted unsuccessfully to dissuade them from carrying out the act; and iii) that he remained at a
                    distance from the armed men when the shooting was taking place. The Prosecution replied that the
                    Appellant in no way demonstrated that the Trial Chamber committed errors occasioning a miscarriage
                    of justice with regard to the Appellant’s criminal responsibility for the Drina River incident.<a

                    this ground of appeal should be dismissed as it does not reveal an error, but


                    rather is asking the Appeals Chamber to substitute the Trial Chamber’s finding with that of the

                    the Trial Chamber erred both in law and fact by concluding that he intented to kill the seven Muslim
                    men and therefore, that he is guilty of murder. The alleged error of fact concerned the Appellant’s
                    intent to kill. The errors of law concerned: i) whether the Appellant’s convictions are cumulative;
                    ii) whether there was an agreement among the Appellant, Milan Lukić and the two unknown men and;

                    kill the seven Muslim men, and ii) that the Appellant personally participated in this joint criminal

                <p id="p-v-926"> 198.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the sixth ground of appeal, the Appellant submits that
                    the Trial Chamber erred in finding him guilty of persecution as a crime against humanity for the
                    murder of five Muslim men and the inhumane acts inflicted (Count 3) on two other Muslim men in
                    relation to the Drina River incident. The main argument presented by the Appellant is that he did
                    not act with the requisite discriminatory intent for the crime of persecution. In his submissions,
                    the Appellant raised a number of arguments which are already included in the other grounds of
                    appeal. The Appellant first submits that the Trial Chamber erred in
                    finding that he acted as an informant to the Milan Lukić group.<a id="p-v-927"
                                                                                       class="fn"

                    Second, the Appellant believes that

                    there is no evidence for finding beyond reasonable doubt that he intended to kill the seven Muslim

                    is not sufficient to establish that there was such an agreement and therefore to find the Appellant

                    first sub-ground, the Appellant argued that the Trial Chamber committed an error of law by failing
                    to indicate the criteria applied in order to establish the existence of a joint criminal enterprise
