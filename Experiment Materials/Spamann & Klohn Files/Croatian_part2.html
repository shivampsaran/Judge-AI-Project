         In addition, there was no legal basis specifically regulating the transfer of HV military personnel to the HVO. HV members were reassigned to these armies pursuant to Article 271 of the Law on Service in the Armed Forces, which generally provided for the temporary
         assignment to other military units or institutions within the JNA.<a id="tc-c-3139" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Ex.

Documentary evidence shows that as of 19 May 1993, 1,607 former JNA officers remained in the HVO. From 19 May until 8 October 1993, pursuant to Article 271 of the above mentioned law, additional 1,023 HV officers were deployed to the HVO, Ex.

         In March 1993, Petkovi&#263; sent a letter to Panić, then serving as Chief of HV General Staff, which illustrates the shortcomings of this arrangement. Petkovi&#263; complained that military personnel were leaving the HVO to return to the HV without authorisation from the HVO Main Staff, stating that their deployment to the HVO from the HV was only temporary.<a id="tc-c-3140" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Ex. P1529, Letter of Milivoj Petkovi&#263; to the Chief of the HV General Staff, 31 March 1993, p. 1."><sup>2115</sup></a>

         <div id="tc-c-3143" class="col-md-10"><small>
                 The Main Staff of the HVO , since its establishment, believed that … the SVK, HVO and HV were only separate elements of the combat disposition of a single army. We consider this assumption to be the legal basis for the obligatory engagement of members of the HV regardless of their place of origin in the units of the HVO and its combat operations, and the engagement of
                 those whose roots are in the HR H-B a moral and patriotic act and an obligation.<a id="tc-c-3144" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Ibid."><sup>2116</sup></a>

     <p id="tc-c-3146">&nbsp;</p>
     <p id="tc-c-3147">
         Petkovi&#263; therefore asked Panić to adopt “an enactment making it obligatory for all active military personnel who come from the former Bosnia and Herzegovina to join the HVO at the request of the Main Staff of the HVO ”. He also proposed that “ a ll those who refuse to comply with this request must be removed from the HV in an appropriate procedure … ”.<a id="tc-c-3148" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Ex.

         He also lamented that military personnel from the former JNA or HV already serving in the HVO, were penalised in terms of rights and benefits compared to HV personnel that remained in the HR and asked that instead they be guaranteed equal treatment.<a id="tc-c-3149" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Ibid."><sup>2118</sup></a>
         There is no evidence as to whether Panić took any steps in response to Petkovi&#263;’s letter.
     </p>
     <p id="tc-c-3150">763.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After replacing Panić as Chief of HV General Staff, Horvat took official steps to answer Petkovi&#263;’s request. In late September or early October 1993, Horvat sent a proposed order to Tu&#273;man regarding the regulation of the status and dispatch of military personnel to the HVO.<a id="tc-c-3151" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Ex. P1873, Set of HV General Staff and HR MOD Documents, Doc IDs 0630-6535, 0630-6536. See also Ex. P778, Stenographic Transcript of the 25th Session of the SDC, 30 August 1994, p. 66."><sup>2119</sup></a>
         The statement of reasons for this proposal expressly stated that since the withdrawal of the JNA from the territories of the Former Yugoslavia, three issues remained open: i) the legal status and rights of JNA military personnel who remained in the HVO; ii) the fact that there was no legal basis to temporarily dispatch HV military personnel to the HVO; and iii) the enjoyment of rights (salaries, housing, promotions, personal record in the HV, etc.) of all of the above personnel in the HV and HR.<a id="tc-c-3152" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Ex. P1873, Set of HV General Staff and HR MOD Documents, Doc ID 0630-6538, p. 1."><sup>2120</sup></a>
         The statements of reasons also indicated that until then, the Chief of the HV General Staff dealt with these issues based on temporary “standpoints”, “without any legal basis and in a semi legal manner”.<a id="tc-c-3153" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Ibid."><sup>2121</sup></a>
         The proposal also included termination of service as a sanction in case of refusal to comply with the transfer order.<a id="tc-c-3154" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Ex. P1873, Set of HV General Staff and HR MOD Documents, Doc IDs 0630-6538, p. 2, 0630-6536, p. 2."><sup>2122</sup></a>
         The proposed order – with a minor revision and a more detailed statement of reasons – was inserted in the agenda for discussion at the SDC session of 11 October 1993.<a id="tc-c-3155" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="The revision was made at the proposal of the Administration for System and Status-Related Issues of the HR MOD and concerned the addition of persons born in Bosnia and Croatia who had been dispatched from there to the JNA for trainings or service in the JNA to the list of those for whom the HV General Staff had to keep record of, Ex.

     </p>
     <p id="tc-c-3156">764.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the new statement of reasons, Horvat reiterated that there was no “solid legal framework” for sending HV personnel outside of the HR without their consent. As a consequence, this could expose the HV to potential litigation and exposure to the “local and foreign public”.<a id="tc-c-3157" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Ex. P1872, Set of HV General Staff and HR MOD Documents, Doc ID 0630-6544, p. 2."><sup>2124</sup></a>
         In Horvat’s view, the proposed order therefore represented “the only possible solution … given the current circumstances, the position of the HR and HV and fulfilment of the request of the Main Staffs of the HVO ”.<a id="tc-c-3158" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Ibid."><sup>2125</sup></a>
         He then described the mechanism through which HV personnel would serve in the HVO :

     <div id="tc-c-3159" class="row">
         <div id="tc-c-3160" class="col-md-1"></div>
         <div id="tc-c-3161" class="col-md-10"><small>
                 The relevant officer in the HV would make all these persons available and send them to a special organ of the HV General Staff (Personnel Administration) based in Zagreb. Further procedure to organise and implement the departure of these persons and resolve their status in service while they are outside of the HV will be taken over by the authorised organs of the Main Staff of the HVO or SVK . All the rights of these active servicemen and civilians would be fully protected and
                 enjoyed in the same manner and scope as for other professionals in the HV.<a id="tc-c-3162" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Ibid."><sup>2126</sup></a>

     </div>
     <p id="tc-c-3164">&nbsp;</p>
     <p id="tc-c-3165">
         The most contentious issue was the termination of service of those military personnel who refused redeployment to the HVO . As there was no direct legal basis for the said termination, Horvat proposed alternative means to achieve it, including early retirement, termination due to special needs of service and interests of the HV or by order of a military disciplinary court for refusal to carry out an order.<a id="tc-c-3166" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Ex.

     </p>
     <p id="tc-c-3167">765.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the SDC session of 11 October 1993, Horvat presented his proposed order to Franjo Tu&#273;man and Momir Bulatović:

                 These are personnel issues related to officers in the HVO. We have 3,612 people there whose status has not been regulated under the new law. In order to have a foothold, we have paved the way for the President of the state, in his capacity as Supreme Commander, to issue an order regulating their status and that of officers here. And in order to avoid having anyone criticise us, we have devised a temporary formation in the HV . We appoint them here; they are not actually here but are performing their duties over where they are stationed. … We must create a stronghold so that the General Staff can work on these issues to a certain extent within the spirit of the law, even though this is not entirely in conformity with the law. But we cannot see a better
                 solution.<a id="tc-c-3171" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Ex. P709, Stenographic Transcript of the 14th Session of the SDC, 11 October 1993, p. 32 (emphasis added)."><sup>2128</sup></a>

     <p id="tc-c-3173">&nbsp;</p>
     <p id="tc-c-3174">766.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Horvat then proceeded to explain the issue of ordering HV officers to perform their duties in the HVO in order to meet these armies’ pressing requests for military personnel. According to Horvat, HV soldiers who refused such a transfer order should be considered deserters.<a id="tc-c-3175" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Ex.

         Horvat also stated that he had found the appropriate solutions to deal with those who refused to respond to the call, including early retirement:

         <div id="tc-c-3178" class="col-md-10"><small>
                 For instance, if someone doesn’t want to go and has over 30 years of pensionable employment, we can give him early retirement so that we’re not accepting this. We’ll tell him that he is not performing his duties in a satisfactory manner and other things, but we won’t write that he did not want to go there.<a id="tc-c-3179" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Ex.

     <p id="tc-c-3182">767.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Momir Bulatović, though in favour of obligatory deployment, expressed concern that such a coercive method would become public and suggested that the order be revised in that regard.<a id="tc-c-3183" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Ex. P709, Stenographic Transcript of the 14th Session of the SDC, 11 October 1993, pp 33-36. Horvat stated “ j ust so we do not have to wait for the next Council session, should I throw out everything that pertains to repressive actions – if they wont go – and leave everything else in the order?”; Tu&#273;man responded that the matter would have to be discussed at the next Council session, ibid., pp 35, 37."><sup>2131</sup></a>

         Although the new version of the draft order did not contain any reference to the termination of service of HV members who refused to transfer to the HVO or SVK, it suggested that such refusal would have an adverse impact on the future promotion of those soldiers within the HV.

     <p id="tc-c-3221">777.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Trial Chamber finds that Horvat had a decisive role in the creation of the PCs. The evidence set out above shows that he conceived and subsequently carefully implemented the idea to create such centres to: (i) regularise the status of all former JNA and HV military personnel who remained in BiH and Croatia and (ii) to legalise, as far as possible, the deployment of HV military personnel to the HVO. In doing so, Horvat intended to meet the requests for military personnel by the HVO Main Staffs.

     <p id="tc-c-3260">785.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Trial Chamber further notes that Exhibit P1523 also illustrates this covert transfer of HV officers through the PCs. Exhibit P1523 is an order of the Chief of the Personnel Administration of the HV General Staff dated 15 February 1994 which appoints Bogdan Sladojević and Milan
         Čeleketić to the 11th and 18th Corps, respectively, of the 40th PC.<a id="tc-c-3261" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Ex. P1523, Order by HV General Staff Personnel Administration, 15 February 1994, pp 2-3."><sup>2176</sup></a>

         Stamenko Nikolić explained that neither the 11th nor the 18th Corps ever existed in the HV.<a id="tc-c-3263" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Stamenko Nikolić, T. 10604-10605."><sup>2178</sup></a>
         Instead, both Corps were part of the SVK and the two garrison numbers mentioned in the order refer, in fact, to the 11th and 18th Corps command in the SVK and not to Zagreb garrisons.<a id="tc-c-3264" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Stamenko Nikolić, T. 10605-10606.

         In addition, Nikolić commented on the date “101193” (10 November 1993) printed in relation to each officer’s appointment and explained that the date was a code for Tu&#273;man’s order of 10 November 1993 regarding the formation of the PCs.<a id="tc-c-3265" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Stamenko Nikolić, T. 10604-10605; Ex.

     </p><p id="tc-c-3267">786.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact that the PCs were not purely administrative bodies is equally evidenced by Tu&#273;man’s order of February 1994 that the HV supply the 30th and 40th PCs with weapons and military equipment. To this end, the order further authorised the Chief of HV General Staff to reconcile the needs of the PCs with the means of the HV and to regulate the supply of weapons and military
     equipment to the PCs.<a id="tc-c-3268" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Ex. P1009, Order of the President of the HR, 18 February 1994."><sup>2182</sup></a>

     <p id="tc-c-3269">787.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, the Trial Chamber is satisfied that the PCs’ main function was to regulate the status of all those former JNA/HV officers who remained to serve in the HVO after the withdrawal of the JNA and to allow the HV to secretly transfer HV military personnel to the HVO , ensuring that they all continued to enjoy and exercise their rights in the HV and HR while serving in those armies. To this end, the PCs accessory function was to keep record of all former JNA and HV personnel serving in the HVO . The Trial Chamber is equally satisfied that all the SDC members, as well as Horvat, intended to keep this function and the HV involvement in the conflicts secret in order to avoid criticism or risking further sanctions from the international community. As described above, under the cover of a formal appointment to the PCs, HV personnel were transferred directly to the HVO . The need and intention to keep this function secret was clearly expressed at the SDC session of 11 October 1993 while discussing the order on the establishment of the PCs. Horvat admitted that the establishment of the PCs had been devised in order to “avoid having anyone criticise us” for the number of former JNA and HV personnel serving in the HVO .<a id="tc-c-3270" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Ex P709, Stenographic Transcript of the 14th Session of the SDC, 11 October 1993, p. 32."><sup>2183</sup></a>

         The need to ensure secrecy was stressed again at the following session of 10 November 1993, when the order was finalised and eventually signed.

     <p id="tc-c-3347">797.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evidence shows that HV officers were transferred and/or appointed to the 30th or 40th PCs by the HV, whereas the HVO appointed these officers to specific posts within these armies.<a id="tc-c-3348" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Ex.

In its closing arguments, the Prosecution did not dispute that the “HVO made the majority of decisions as to assignment to duty within those armies”, Prosecution Closing Arguments, T. 14689."><sup>2242</sup></a>
         While accepting this as the general rule, the Prosecution argues that on occasion, the HV would also appoint PC members to specific posts within the HVO. The prosecution relies on two orders of appointment, dated 12 August and 6 October 1995, regarding, inter alia, Vujadin Popović
         and Dragan Obrenović.<a id="tc-c-3349" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Prosecution Final Brief, para. 183, referring to Ex.

         The Prosecution points out that in these cases, the order of transfer and appointment of HV military personnel to the HVO through the PCs included internal appointments to different units within those armies - namely to the positions of Corps Chief of Security Department, Security and Intelligence Affairs and Infantry Brigade Chief of Staff, respectively.<a id="tc-c-3350" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Prosecution Final Brief, para. 183."><sup>2244</sup></a>

     <p id="tc-c-3351">798.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Defence disputes the proposition that the HV could decide on appointments within the

     </p>
     <p id="tc-c-3353">799.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Trial Chamber notes that both Popović and Obrenović held the positions of Corps Chief of Security Department, Security and Intelligence Affairs and Infantry Brigade Chief of Staff, respectively, before the HV orders of appointment cited by the Prosecution were issued. The order of 12 August 1995 on Popović’s appointment, states that the appointment was effective as of 1
         February 1995, “when he assumed duty”.<a id="tc-c-3354" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Ex. P2126, Order by HV General Staff Personnel Administration, 12 August 1995, p. 14."><sup>2246</sup></a>
         This is reflected in his HV personnel file.<a id="tc-c-3355" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Ex. P1934, HV Personnel File of Vujadin Popović, Doc ID 0422-8609, p. 2."><sup>2247</sup></a>
         Similarly, the appointment order of 6 October 1995 relating to Obrenović states that his appointment to Chief of Staff of the Infantry Brigade was effective as of 1 August 1995, “when changes were effected in the unit establishment”.<a id="tc-c-3356" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Ex. P1815, Order by HV General Staff, 6 October 1995, p. 26."><sup>2248</sup></a>
         In addition, Obrenović was already “transferred and appointed” to the same position by HV order of 9 February 1994, effective as of 10 November 1993.<a id="tc-c-3357" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Ex. P2129, Order by HV General Staff Personnel Administration, 9 February 1994, p. 35."><sup>2249</sup></a>
         As discussed above, these orders of February 1994, were issued to harmonise the status of HV personnel already serving in the HVO with Tu&#273;man’s order establishing the PCs.<a id="tc-c-3358" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="See supra para. 785."><sup>2250</sup></a>
         The evidence therefore shows that contrary to the Prosecution position, Popović and Obrenović were not appointed to those specific positions within the HVO by HV order. The Trial Chamber therefore finds that while the HV appointed HV personnel to the 30th and 40th PCs, the appointment to specific posts within the HVO was done by those armies.

For example, in March 1994, Panić, the Commander of the Special Units Corps (“SUC”), agreed to send two sergeants to the HVO for one year pursuant to Article 58 of the Law on the HV, with the understanding that the two soldiers were not appointed to the 30th PC and that they would return to the SUC before the expiration of the year in case of engagement of the SUC in combat.<a id="tc-c-3373" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Ex.

         This policy did not change over time and Horvat addressed the issue during the SDC meeting of 21 July 1994.

For example, on 5 September 1994, the Chief of the HV General Staff ordered the deployment of a number of HV officers to the 40th PC, but a number of them either refused to obey the order or subsequently and deliberately left the units of the 40th PC.<a id="tc-c-3390" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Ex.

     <p id="tc-c-3519">830.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on the foregoing, the Trial Chamber finds that as a rule, personnel serving in the HVO through the 30th and 40th PCs could be redeployed to HV units. The evidence clearly shows that when the request for redeployment came from the PC member himself, it was granted only if his superior in the HVO consented to such transfer; subsequently, the HV would order the transfer. At the same time, the record contains some HV orders of transfer initiated by the HV, rather than by the PC member, transferring both 30th and 40th PC members back to the HV, without evidence of prior approval from the HVO. However, in light of the testimony of Škrbić and Gajić, the Trial Chamber cannot conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that these HV orders for redeployment could be carried out without approval from the HVO .

         In all of these cases, the parties did not dispute that during the period for which compensation was sought, the officers, as HV members, were serving outside the HV on orders of a superior officer and that they did not use their annual leave. The Military Supreme Court reversed the decision of the PCs denying those claims and affirmed that because the claimants were professional soldiers of the HV during the period in question, the provisions of the Law on the HV applied to them.<a id="tc-c-3535" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Ibid."><sup>2351</sup></a>

                 It is the legal understanding of the Court that the legal position of a serviceman whom the competent officer sent outside the HV and who did not take his annual leave due to a raised level of combat readiness and engagement in combat operations, is to be brought in line with the position of a serviceman whose annual leave was suspended or cut short by the Chief of the HV General Staff due to extraordinary needs of service.<a id="tc-c-3539" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Ex.

                 The court is of the opinion that this objection was not valid since, based on the evidence presented during the proceedings, it was established beyond reasonable doubt that the plaintiff was a professional officer of the HV at the time of wounding and was on its payroll throughout that time and that his participation on the front in the general sector of Zlatište near Mostar was certainly in agreement with or with the knowledge of the General Staff of the HV . Had that not been the case, an unauthorized arrival of the plaintiff as a professional officer of the HV at the front in another, internationally recognized state would have resulted in the termination of his employment, and neither did his superior ever initiate such a measure against the plaintiff, nor was evidence to that effect presented before this court by the end of the proceedings.<a id="tc-c-3552" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Ex.

That is to say that we had two systems of laws, if I can put it that way, according to which we worked, the laws of Republika Srpska; and in order to have that verified, it had to be adjusted to the regulations in the Army of
             Yugoslavia so that it could be sent to the accounting centre so their salaries could be calculated.

         The Trial Chamber recalls Škrbić’s testimony that indeed the HVO Main Staff drew up statements of reasons and completed “promotion questionnaires” for all the promotions it granted, but none of these were provided to the 30th PC.

         Through the PCs, therefore, Horvat had at his disposal information on all personnel serving in the PCs.

He therefore had information available that he would assess to decide whether those officers were suitable for a promotion within the HV.

     <h5> <u>(v)&nbsp;Final Findings</u> </h5>
     <p id="tc-c-3668">866.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In sum, the Trial Chamber finds that as a general rule, promotions were first granted in the HVO in accordance with the laws of the HR H-B. The HVO Main Staffs would then send a list of promotions to the HV General Staff with a request that they be verified. The Trial Chamber is also satisfied that the verification and promotions within the HV were made according to the Law on the HV. Hence, Horvat retained the authority to promote members of the PCs up to and including the rank of Colonel and had the power of proposal to the HR President for exceptional promotion to the rank of General. The Trial Chamber also finds that Horvat decided whether a promotion in the HV was merited based on his own assessment of character and performance of the members of the PCs proposed for promotion verification. Finally, the verification and corresponding promotion in the HV allowed the PC members to enjoy the benefits and rights attached to the new rank, most importantly a commensurate salary.

         Specifically, on 18 May 1994 and later, on 8 April 1997, Petkovi&#263; was granted compensation for “expenses incurred for living apart from his family”.

             <sup>2535</sup></a>
         The decision of 8 April 1997 refers specifically to the fact that although Petkovi&#263; was not provided an “official apartment at his place of service”, he was provided with accommodation at the military facility at Han Pijesak garrison where he was serving.

             <sup>2536</sup></a>
         Additionally, both decisions confirm that Petkovi&#263; had a separate family residence in Zagreb, while the 8 April 1997 decision further indicates that Petkovi&#263; was “relocated from the Zagreb Garrison, where he had a settled housing issue/permanent housing provided/, to the Han Pijesak Garrison … ”.

     <p id="tc-c-3945">933.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Trial Chamber finds that pursuant to the Law on the HV, the HR President and Horvat possessed the authority to terminate the professional military service of personnel assigned to the 30th and 40th PCs. Furthermore, both the HR President and Horvat exercised this authority, as demonstrated by the numerous examples of decrees and orders terminating the military service of personnel serving in the PCs.
     </p>
     <p id="tc-c-3946">934.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Trial Chamber further finds that the HR H-B presidential decrees and corresponding HVO Military Post decisions relied on by the Defence to demonstrate that termination of service for members of the 30th PC was only within the purview of the HR H-B and HVO were, in fact, issued after the war and following the disbandment of the 30th PC. As a result, the Trial Chamber is not convinced that this practice calls into question Horvat’s authority to terminate the military service of the members of the 30th PC.
     </p>
     <p id="tc-c-3947">935.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Trial Chamber finds that the evidence does not support the Defence argument that the decrees issued by Horvat or by the HR President on termination of service for members of the PCs were preceded by HR H-B Presidential Decrees, nor that such decrees were only issued to regulate status-related rights of the concerned personnel.

Kadijević again insisted that Horvat had no authority over this matter: “It is evident that this document does not reflect the regular procedure in Republika Srpska. … Normally the director of this company, Motika, would need to approach HR H-B MOD and they in turn would need to contact HR MOD and that would be the end of the procedure.

     <p id="tc-c-4260">1007.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The foregoing evidence conclusively demonstrates that Ante Horvat, as Chief of the HV General Staff, oversaw the administration of logistical assistance for the military needs of the HVO . In fact, Horvat convinced the SDC to give him the legal authority to do so in an effort to comply with the HR’s Law on Property.
         <a id="tc-c-4261" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Ex. P782, Stenographic Transcript of 18th Session of the SDC, 7 February 1994, p. 53; Ex. P1009, Order of HR President, 18 February 1994.">
             <sup>2863</sup></a>
         That being noted, the Trial Chamber considers that the question of greater relevance is not what the HR’s domestic legislation technically stipulated, but the actual role that Horvat played in the logistical assistance process.
     </p>
     <p id="tc-c-4262">1008.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Horvat’s role went beyond administering the logistical assistance process. Horvat participated in the SDC’s deliberations on logistical assistance to the HVO , and recurrently encouraged the SDC to maintain this assistance, thereby helping craft the HR’s policy to aid these armies.
     </p>
     <p id="tc-c-4263">1009.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Insofar as Horvat opposed certain requests conflicting with the HV’s own needs, that fact does not signify that Horvat generally opposed logistical assistance or sought to keep it to a minimum. Rather, Horvat’s role in coordinating the process, his statements before the SDC, and his approval of extensive assistance to the HVO

Horvat’s remarks before the HV Collegium at the end of the war are equally instructive: “I could have retained the material reserves, all the material reserves to retain them here to the maximum, to give as little as possible material reserves away …. We gave all we had always and I am not sorry for that, as we defended the people as much as we could”.

An undated document from “the logistics sector”, presumably of the HV, states that all the HVO requests had been met that far, although further provisions would only be possible from the “surplus of unpromising equipment”. The document adds that the HV does not have the financial capacity to provide weaponry produced by HR factories to the HVO . The latter “should” make arrangements through the HR MOD so that weaponry can be delivered from the “production sector, with the funding plan ensured”. The document adds that the HV “can still provide ammunition for 7.9 calibre weapons from its own surpluses”, whereas it can no longer give fuel because “its own reserves have dropped below the allowed minimum”. It goes on to reach the following conclusion: “The HV has depleted its capabilities, reserves and resources of logistical support and the only logistical support it can provide is insufficient for the actual needs of the HVO and HVOK [<i>sic</i>]”, Ex.

             <sup>2891</sup></a>
         Kodžopeljić’s position was that property was tracked in an automated database relying on 12-digit nomenclature numbers without which “nobody would know what we were talking about”.

             <sup>2892</sup></a>
         The Trial Chamber finds Kodžopeljić unpersuasive. Even though an improper nomenclature number might pose problems for tracking information in that database, it does not render a material list unintelligible if one can read on its face the names of the items provided.

     <p id="tc-c-4306">1019.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to Ex.

             <sup>2894</sup></a>
         The Trial Chamber considers that whether a form has sufficient information for purposes of HV administrative and financial planning is irrelevant and does not render a delivery form incomprehensible on its face. Assuming Kodžopeljić was correct in stating that the person who filled out the form was the recipient, that fact alone would not render the form unreliable.

         The Trial Chamber considers that a sending stamp or signature raises a presumption of delivery. The HR-HR H-B border was porous and the HV could easily send large quantities of weaponry to the HVO with minimal risk that any weapons would be intercepted by international border monitors.

         The Trial Chamber finds that the mere fact that some boxes were left blank on a delivery form featuring multiple boxes does not raise a reasonable doubt as to the reliability of the forms. The Trial Chamber notes that MP-14 acknowledged that most material delivery forms were “incomplete”, but credibly explained that, in times of war, it was “practically impossible” to follow all rules and regulations regarding paperwork, partly because there was insufficient manpower to do so.

         A letter from General Novica Simić of the Eastern Bosnia Corps Command, dated 2 August 1995, indicates that the Posavina Light Infantry Brigade had obtained from the HV, with the permission of the HVO Main Staff, 1,680 shells, 1,200 rockets, 180 bullet rounds and 33 pieces for machine-gun barrels.

     <p id="tc-c-4510">1067.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between 16 and 23 September 1995, the Eastern Bosnia Corps received from the HR a total of 1,046,035 bullets of various calibres, 934 mortar shells, 150 rockets, 72 rounds for RRB 64mm, 1,999 semi-automatic rifles, 50 machine guns, 18 cannons and 15 pieces of “LRL 128mm M-71”.

             <sup>3042</sup></a>
         Whereas the Eastern Bosnia Corps’s report to the HVO Main Staff simply states that this weaponry originated from the “FRY”, the only reasonable inference is that it was provided by the HV General Staff or the HR special purpose industries.
         <a id="tc-c-4512" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="See infra section VI.C.9.">
             <sup>3043</sup></a>
         For the reasons stated above, the only reasonable inference is that the Eastern Bosnia Corps was referring to officially-approved assistance when it informed the HVO Main Staff that it had procured these supplies from the HR, as Petkovi&#263; ordered that HVO units who engaged in unauthorised procurement would face disciplinary measures.

         The Trial Chamber concludes that the Eastern Bosnia Corps’s report equally shows that the sanctions were not enforced.

     <p id="tc-c-4514">1068.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The HR H-B MOD determined that the HVO obtained immense quantities of weaponry between August 1994 and November 1995, precisely the period of sanctions by the HR on HR H-B; to wit 61,590,737 rounds of rifle ammunition, 92,125 rounds of “other infantry ammunition”, 73,184 rounds of mortar ammunition, 14,615 rounds of artillery ammunition, 5,915 rounds of tank ammunition, 1,708 missiles, 298,593 items of “anti-aircraft ammunition and missiles”, 60 aerial bombs, as well as 108,995 items of “launch equipment and other NVO /weapons and military equipment/”.

         The HR H-B MOD’s report merely identifies this weaponry as “purchases and donations” without specifying its source.

             <sup>3046</sup></a>
         Nevertheless, the trial record solely establishes that the HVO received ammunition from the HV and the HR special purpose industries.

             <sup>3052</sup></a>
         Borović went as far as claiming that no documents establish that the HV assisted the HVO in violation of the military sanctions.

         The Trial Chamber does not find Borović’s testimony credible in light of the overwhelming evidence to the contrary.
