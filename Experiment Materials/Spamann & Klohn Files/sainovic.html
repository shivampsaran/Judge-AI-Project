In addition to crimes purportedly committed in March 1999 and thereafter, the Indictment alleges that crimes were committed in Račak/Reçek in January 1999 (see Indictment, para. 75(a)). However, pursuant to Rule 73 bis (D) of the Tribunal’s Rules of Procedure and Evidence (“Rules”), the Trial Chamber refused to allow evidence to be led in relation to the charge in paragraph 75(a) of the Indictment. Although the Trial Chamber stated that this charge still existed and that all accused in the case remained charged in relation thereto (Prosecutor v.

In the Trial Judgement, the Trial Chamber made no finding as to the charge in paragraph 75(a)  of  the  Indictment.  Subsequent  to  the  delivery  of  the  Trial  Judgement,  and  after  hearing  the Prosecution’s views, the Trial Chamber declared that there remained no outstanding charges against the accused before the Tribunal (Prosecutor v.

<p id="p-s-144">19.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On appeal, parties must limit their arguments to legal errors that invalidate the decision of the trial chamber and to factual errors that result in a miscarriage of justice.<a id="p-s-145"   class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover"   data-content="Perišić Appeal Judgement, para. 7; Lukić and Lukić Appeal Judgement, para. 10; Haradinaj et al.

In exceptional circumstances, the Appeals Chamber will also hear appeals in which a party has raised a legal issue that would not lead to the invalidation of the trial judgement but that is nevertheless of general significance to the Tribunal’s jurisprudence.<a id="p-s-147"   class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover"   data-content="Perišić Appeal Judgement, para. 7; Lukić and Lukić Appeal Judgement, para. 10; Haradinaj et al.

<p id="p-s-148">20.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A party alleging an error of law must identify the alleged error, present arguments in support of its claim, and explain how the error invalidates the decision.<a id="p-s-149"   class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover"   data-content="Perišić Appeal Judgement, para. 8; Lukić and Lukić Appeal Judgement, para. 11; Haradinaj et al.

However, even if the party’s arguments are insufficient to support the contention of an error, the Appeals Chamber may still conclude for other reasons that there is an error of law.<a id="p-s-151"   class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover"   data-content="Perišić Appeal Judgement, para. 8; Lukić and Lukić Appeal Judgement, para. 11; Haradinaj et al.

In so doing, the Appeals Chamber not only corrects the legal error, but, when necessary, applies the correct legal standard to the evidence contained in the trial record and determines whether it is itself convinced beyond reasonable doubt as to the factual finding challenged by an appellant before the finding is confirmed on appeal.<a id="p-s-156"   class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover"   data-content="Perišić Appeal Judgement, para. 9; Lukić and Lukić Appeal Judgement, para. 12; Haradinaj et al.

The Appeals Chamber will not review the entire trial record de novo.

<p id="p-s-168"><small>Pursuant to the jurisprudence of the Tribunal, the task of hearing, assessing and weighing the evidence presented at trial is left primarily to the Trial Chamber.

Only where the evidence relied on by the Trial Chamber could not have been accepted by any reasonable tribunal of fact or where the evaluation of the evidence is “wholly erroneous” may the Appeals Chamber substitute its own finding for that of the Trial Chamber.<a id="p-s-169"   class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover"   data-content="Kupreškić et al.

Thus, when considering an appeal by the Prosecution, the Appeals Chamber will only hold that an error of fact was committed when it determines that no reasonable trier of fact could have made the impugned finding.<a id="p-s-173"   class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover"   data-content="Boškoski and Tarčulovski Appeal Judgement, para. 15; Mrkšić and Šljivančanin Appeal Judgement, para. 15; Martić Appeal Judgement, para. 12; Strugar Appeal Judgement, para. 14."><sup>93</sup></a>

<p id="p-s-283">1618.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certain decisions of the Appeals Chamber have described the actus reus of aiding and abetting liability with reference to “specific direction.” The Tadić Appeal Judgement described the actus reus of aiding and abetting liability as “acts specifically directed to assist, encourage or lend moral support to the perpetration of a certain specific crime”.<a id="p-s-284"   class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover"   data-content="Tadić Appeal Judgement, para. 229 (emphasis added)."><sup>5307</sup></a>

</p>

<p id="p-s-296">1621.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Appeals Chamber, Judge Tuzmukhamedov dissenting, considers that in effect, the interpretation favored by Lazarević would appear to be at odds not only with a plain reading of the Mrkšić and Šljivančanin Appeal Judgement, which states that specific direction is not an “essential ingredient” of aiding and abetting liability,<a id="p-s-297"   class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover"   data-content="The  Appeals  Chamber  observes  that  the  Mrkšić  and  Šljivančanin  Appeal  Judgement  cited  a  section  of  the Blagojević and Jokić Appeal Judgement which stated that a finding of specific direction “will often be implicit in the finding that the accused has provided practical assistance to the principal perpetrator which had a substantial effect on the commission of a crime” (see Blagojević and Jokić Appeal Judgement, para. 189). However, for the reasons set out below, the Appeals Chamber considers that the Mrkšić and Šljivančanin Appeal Judgement did not depart from the Blagojević and Jokić Appeal Judgement (see infra, paras 1625, 1650). Moreover, the Appeals Chamber does not agree with Lazarević’s proposition that the issue of specific direction was merely considered in passing in the Mrkšić and Šljivančanin Appeal Judgement. The Appeals Chamber further considers that Lazarević places undue emphasis on the fact that in the Mrkšić and Šljivančanin Appeal Judgement specific direction was discussed in a section that also addressed the mens rea of aiding and abetting. In this regard, the Appeals Chamber notes that the Mrkšić and Šljivančanin Appeal Judgement clearly considered specific direction in the context of the actus reus of aiding and abetting liability. Significantly, it stated that: “specific direction is not an essential ingredient of the actus  reus  of aiding and abetting” (see Mrkšić and  Šljivančanin  Appeal Judgement, para. 159 (emphasis added)). Finally, the Appeals Chamber considers that the Mrkšić and Šljivančanin Appeal Judgement did not state cogent reasons for departing from earlier precedent because, for the reasons set out below, that precedent did not clearly establish a specific direction requirement. Judge Tuzmukhamedov dissents from the reasoning in this footnote."><sup>5317</sup></a>
but also with the Lukić and Lukić
Appeal  Judgement,  which  confirmed  this  holding.<a id="p-s-298"   class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover"   data-content="Lukić and Lukić Appeal Judgement, para. 424. The Appeals Chamber does not agree with Lazarević’s proposition that the Lukić and Lukić Appeal Judgement confirmed that the Mrkšić and Šljivančanin Appeal Judgement is not antithetical in its approach to specific direction."><sup>5318</sup></a>
In  this  respect,  the  Appeals  Chamber considers that when interpreting a particular judgement, primary consideration should be given to positions expressly taken and clearly set out in the judgement concerned. It is not clear that this approach  is being followed by Lazarević  with  respect  to  the  issue  of  specific direction as expressed in the Mrkšić and Šljivančanin and Lukić and Lukić Appeal Judgements. It would thus be more appropriate to conclude that the Mrkšić and Šljivančanin Appeal Judgement and the Lukić and Lukić Appeal Judgement, on one hand, and Lazarević’s position, on the other hand, diverge on the issue of specific direction.

<p id="p-s-299">1622.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Appeals Chamber recalls that where it is faced with previous decisions that are conflicting, it is obliged to determine which decision it will follow, or whether to depart from both decisions for cogent reasons in the interests of justice.<a id="p-s-300"   class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover"   data-content="Aleksovski Appeal Judgement, para. 111."><sup>5319</sup></a>
In view of the apparent divergence between the Mrkšić and Šljivančanin and Lukić and Lukić Appeal Judgements, on one hand, and  the Tadić Appeal Judgement and other judgments citing it, on the other hand, the Appeals Chamber, Judge Tuzmukhamedov dissenting, will determine the correct approach.<a id="p-s-301"   class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover"   data-content="The Appeals Chamber, Judge Tuzmukhamedov dissenting, further considers that the issue at hand concerns the constituent elements of aiding and abetting liability and that its significance warrants the intervention by the Appeals Chamber. In this regard, the Appeals Chamber also recalls that the issue was raised by the parties (Appeal Hearing, 13 Mar 2013, AT. 402-416, 418-420, 440-460), but that the Trial Chamber made no specific finding on this issue.The Appeals Chamber further considers that even if the application of the requirement of “specific direction” would not ultimately invalidate the Trial Judgement, it may “hear appeals in which a party has raised a legal issue that would not lead to the invalidation of the trial judgement but that is nevertheless of general significance to the Tribunal’s jurisprudence”, so long as such issues have a nexus with the case at hand (see supra, para. 19), and references therein; Prosecutor v. Radoslav Brđanin, Case No. IT-99-36-A, Decision on Motion to Dismiss Ground 1 of the Prosecutor’s Appeal, 5 May 2005, p. 3)."><sup>5320</sup></a>
In so doing, mindful of its duty to act in the interests of legal certainty and predictability while ensuring that justice is done in all cases,<a id="p-s-302"   class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover"   data-content="See Aleksovski Appeal Judgement, paras 101-106, 111."><sup>5321</sup></a>
the Appeals Chamber will consider the jurisprudence of the Tribunal and the ICTR as well as customary international law to ascertain where the law stands on the issue of specific direction.
</p>

<p id="p-s-303">1623.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning first to the jurisprudence of the Tribunal and the ICTR, the Appeals Chamber recalls that the Tadić Appeal Judgement held that an “aider and abettor carries out acts specifically
directed  to  assist,  encourage  or  lend  moral  support  to  the  perpetration  of  a  certain  specific crime”.<a id="p-s-304"   class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover"   data-content="Tadić Appeal Judgement, para. 229."><sup>5322</sup></a>
This  delineation  of  accessorial  liability  appears  in  the  context  of  contrasting  JCE liability with that of aiding and abetting.<a id="p-s-305"   class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover"   data-content="See Aleksovski Appeal Judgement, para. 163. See also Tadić Appeal Judgement, para. 229. See also Blagojević and Jokić Appeal Judgement para. 186, referring to Aleksovski Appeal Judgement, para. 163."><sup>5323</sup></a>
  
Consequently, the Tadić Appeal Judgement, which focused on JCE liability, does not purport to be a comprehensive statement of aiding and abetting liability.<a id="p-s-306"   class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover"   data-content="See Aleksovski Appeal Judgement, para. 163."><sup>5324</sup></a>
The Appeals Chamber, Judge Tuzmukhamedov dissenting, therefore considers that Lazarević’s analysis of the previous case law relies on the flawed premise that the Tadić Appeal Judgement established a precedent with respect to specific direction. As noted in the Perišić Appeal Judgement, subsequent appeal judgements have referred to specific direction, often repeating verbatim the language used in the Tadić Appeal Judgement.<a id="p-s-307"   class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover"   data-content="See Perišić Appeal Judgement, para. 28, fn. 70.

Appeal Judgement, para. 370; Ntakirutimana Appeal Judgement, para. 530. The Ntawukulilyayo and Rukundo Appeal Judgements refer to acts that are “specifically aimed” towards the relevant crimes (see Ntawukulilyayo Appeal Judgement, para. 214; Rukundo Appeal Judgement, para. 52). See also Nahimana et al. Appeal Judgement, para. 482. By contrast, the Simić Appeal Judgement states that “the actus reus of aiding and abetting consists of acts directed to assist, encourage or lend moral support to the perpetration of a specific crime” (see Simić Appeal Judgement, para. 85 (emphasis added)). No mention is made of a “specific direction requirement”. Likewise, the Orić Appeal Judgement provides that “omission must be directed to assist, encourage or lend moral support to the perpetration of a crime and have a substantial effect upon the perpetration of the crime (actus reus)” (see Orić Appeal Judgement, para. 43 (emphasis added))."><sup>5325</sup></a>
However, a number of appeal judgements have not mentioned specific direction when examining the elements of the actus reus of aiding and abetting liability.<a id="p-s-308"   class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover"   data-content="See, e.g., Gotovina and Markač Appeal Judgement, para. 127 (stating that “for an individual to be held liable for aiding and abetting, he must have substantially contributed to a crime and must have known that the acts he performed assisted the principal perpetrator’s crime”); Brđanin Appeal Judgement, para. 151 (stating that “in the case of aiding and abetting, the issue is whether, inter alia, the acts of the aider and abettor had a substantial effect on the commission of the crime of the principal offender”); Krstić Appeal Judgement, para. 137 (containing no explicit mention of specific direction); Karera Appeal Judgement, para. 321 (holding that the “actus reus of aiding and abetting liability is constituted by acts or omissions that assist, further, or lend moral support to the perpetration of a specific crime, and which substantially contribute to the perpetration of the crime”)."><sup>5326</sup></a>
Moreover, the Čelebići Appeal Judgement explicitly  endorsed  a  definition  of  aiding  and  abetting  liability  that  neither  refers  to  specific direction nor contains equivalent language.<a id="p-s-309"   class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover"   data-content="See Čelebići Appeal Judgement, para. 352, citing with approval Čelebići Trial Judgement, para. 327 (defining aiding and abetting as including “all acts of assistance that lend encouragement and support to the perpetration of an offence and which are accompanied by the requisite mens rea.

</p>

<p id="p-s-310">1624.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Appeals Chamber observes that the Čelebići Appeal Judgement was not alone in its endorsement of a trial judgement that defined the actus reus of aiding and abetting liability without
reference to specific direction.<a id="p-s-311"   class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover"   data-content="See, by contrast, Lazarević’s Reply Brief, para 55."><sup>5328</sup></a>
The Blaškić Appeal Judgement explicitly found that the Blaškić Trial Judgement “was correct” in holding that “the actus reus of aiding and abetting ‘consists of practical assistance, encouragement, or moral support which has a substantial effect on the perpetration of the crime.’”<a id="p-s-312"   class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover"   data-content="Blaškić Appeal Judgement, para. 46, quoting Blaškić Trial Judgement, para. 283, in turn quoting Furund`ija  Trial Judgement, para. 249."><sup>5329</sup></a>
In so doing, the Blaškić Appeal Judgement noted that the Blaškić Trial Judgement followed the Furundžija  Trial Judgement,<a id="p-s-313"   class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover"   data-content="Blaškić Appeal Judgement, para. 46, quoting Blaškić Trial Judgement, para. 283, in turn quoting Furund`ija  Trial Judgement, para. 249."><sup>5330</sup></a>

Although the Blaškić Appeal Judgement also referred to the Tadić Appeal Judgement’s formulation of aiding and abetting liability, the fact that the Blaškić Appeal Judgement ultimately relied upon and applied a statement of applicable law that excluded any reference to specific direction strongly suggests that it did not consider specific direction to be an element of aiding and abetting liability.<a id="p-s-315"   class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover"   data-content="Moreover, the Appeals Chamber notes that the Blaškić Appeal Judgement was not the only case to follow this approach. For example, the Krnojelac Appeal Judgement cited the Tadić Appeal Judgement formulation of the actus reus of aiding and abetting liability but proceeded to specify that “by his acts or omissions, the aider and abettor must assist, encourage or lend moral support to the principal perpetrator of the crime and this support must have a substantial effect  upon  the  perpetration  of  the  crime”  (see  Krnojelac  Appeal  Judgement,  paras  33,  37).  Likewise,  the Nahimana et al. Appeal Judgement, having first cited the Tadić language, then proceeded to find that, to convict a defendant of aiding and abetting the commission of a crime, “it is sufficient to prove that the defendant’s acts or omissions substantially contributed to the commission of the crime by the principal perpetrator” (see Nahimana et al. Appeal Judgement, paras 482, 672). See also Kvočka et al. Appeal Judgement, paras 89-90; Kalimanzira Appeal Judgement, para. 74."><sup>5332</sup></a>
</p>

<p id="p-s-316">1625.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After having examined the jurisprudence of the Tribunal, the Blagojević and Jokić Appeal Judgement subsequently confirmed that specific direction is not an element of the actus reus of aiding and abetting liability. While the Blagojević and Jokić Appeal Judgement stated that “the Tadić definition has not been explicitly departed from”, it noted that “specific direction has not always been included as an element of the actus reus of aiding and abetting” and considered that “this may be explained by the fact that such a finding will often be implicit in the finding that the accused has provided practical assistance to the principal perpetrator which had a substantial effect
on the commission of the crime.”<a id="p-s-317"   class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover"   data-content="Blagojević and Jokić Appeal Judgement, para. 189. "><sup>5333</sup></a>
It thus merely observed that specific direction can be at times, 

though not necessarily always, factually implicit in a finding of substantial contribution. In so doing, and in light of the Čelebići and Blaškić precedents, it considered that specific direction is not an element of the actus reus of aiding and abetting, while the substantial contribution of the aider and abettor is.<a id="p-s-318"   class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover"   data-content="The Appeals Chamber notes that the Blagojević and Jokić Appeal Judgement indeed focused on the “principal question” of whether Jokić’s conduct had a substantial effect on the perpetration of the crime (see Blagojević and Jokić Appeal Judgement, paras 191, 193-194)."><sup>5334</sup></a>
Such interpretation is consonant with the fact that, prior to this case, no independent specific direction requirement was applied by the Appeals Chamber to
the facts of any case before it.<a id="p-s-319"   class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover"   data-content="In this regard, the Appeals Chamber notes that specific direction was only ever explicitly addressed in two cases. In the Vasiljević Appeal Judgement, it was mentioned in the context of the substantial contribution of Vasiljević’s acts (see Vasiljević Appeal Judgement, paras 134-135). Significantly, the Vasiljević Appeal Judgement found that, “in preventing the men from escaping on the way to the river bank and during the shooting, the Appellant’s actions had a ‘substantial effect upon the perpetration of the crime’” before concluding that “the acts of the Appellant were specifically directed to assist the perpetration of the murders and the inhumane acts and his support had a substantial effect upon the perpetration of the crimes.” In the Kupreškić et al. case, the Appeals Chamber stated: “Still, mere presence outside the Hotel Vitez cannot be said to amount to an act specifically directed towards assisting, encouraging or lending moral support to the offence of persecution” (Kupreškić et al. Appeal Judgement, para. 283). The Appeals Chamber notes that neither of these appeal judgements engaged in any analysis with respect to the application of specific direction to the facts at issue."><sup>5335</sup></a>
By contrast, the substantial contribution of the accused has consistently been an element of the actus reus of aiding and abetting liability.<a id="p-s-320"   class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover"   data-content="See, e.g., Ntawukulilyayo Appeal Judgement, para. 216 (“The Appeals Chamber considers that it was reasonable for the Trial Chamber to conclude that Ntawukulilyayo substantially contributed to the Kabuye hill killings by encouraging Tutsis to seek refuge there and then providing reinforcements to those attempting to kill them. These acts alone suffice to constitute the actus reus of aiding and abetting”); Rukundo Appeal Judgement, para. 52 (“there is no requirement of a cause-effect relationship between the conduct of the aider and abettor and the commission of the crime nor that such conduct served as a condition precedent to the commission of the crime. It is sufficient for the aider and abettor’s assistance or encouragement to have had a substantial effect on the realisation of that crime, the establishment of which is a ‘fact-based inquiry’. The Appeals Chamber is satisfied that the Trial Chamber’s findings on Rukundo’s role in the attacks, as set out above, demonstrate that his acts substantially contributed to the commission of the crimes”)."><sup>5336</sup></a>
</p>

<p id="p-s-321">1626.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Appeals Chamber further observes that the definition of the actus reus of aiding and abetting as “practical assistance, encouragement, or moral support which has a substantial effect on the perpetration of the crime”<a id="p-s-322"   class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover"   data-content="Blaškić Appeal Judgement, para. 46, quoting Blaškić Trial Judgement, para. 283, in turn quoting Furund`ija  Trial Judgement, para. 249."><sup>5337</sup></a>
reflects customary international law. As noted above, the Blaškić Appeal Judgement approved of this definition without inclusion of specific direction, noting that this standard was initially adopted in the Furundžija Trial Judgement.<a id="p-s-323"   class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover"   data-content="Blaškić Appeal Judgement, para. 46, quoting Blaškić Trial Judgement, para. 283, in turn quoting Furund`ija  Trial Judgement, para. 249."><sup>5338</sup></a>

Nevertheless, in order to dispel any doubt in this regard, the Appeals Chamber will re-examine customary international law concerning the elements of aiding and abetting liability.
</p>

<p id="p-s-325">1627.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Appeals Chamber first turns to examine the jurisprudence which dealt with crimes committed during the Second World War (collectively, “post WWII cases”) and which the Appeals Chamber considers instructive for the purpose of identifying the elements of aiding and abetting liability.<a id="p-s-326"   class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover"   data-content="Some of these cases clearly concern accessorial or aiding and abetting liability. However, there are also cases in which, in light of the limited reasoning and discussion (including in terms of legal characterization of conduct and mens rea), it is difficult to ascertain with certainty under what form of liability the accused was held responsible. The Appeals Chamber has nonetheless considered such cases when there is some indication that aiding and abetting liability might have been applied. In so doing, the Appeals Chamber was mindful of the legal instruments applied in different courts and tribunals, including the Charter of the International Military Tribunal of 8 August 1945 (“IMT Charter”), Control Council Law No. 10, and the British Royal Warrant of 14 June 1945 as well as national legislation."><sup>5340</sup></a>
The Appeals Chamber observes that in none of these relevant cases “specific direction” was required as a distinct element. Rather, they focused on: (i) the degree of each defendant’s contribution to a crime, demonstrated through the role he played in, and the impact he exerted on,

the commission of the crime; and (ii) whether the defendant knew that his acts contributed to the commission of the crime.

constructively present when the felony is committed”<a id="p-s-337"   class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover"   data-content="Schonfeld case, p. 69."><sup>5349</sup></a>
and that there must be “participation in the act” although it is not necessary to prove that he “actually aided in the commission of the offence”.<a id="p-s-338"   class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover"   data-content="Schonfeld case, p. 70."><sup>5350</sup></a>

[I]f [a party] watched for his companions in order to prevent surprise, or remained at a convenient distance in order to favour their escape, if necessary, or was in such a situation as to be able readily to come to their assistance, the knowledge of which was calculated to give additional confidence to his companions, he was, in contemplation of law, present, aiding and abetting.<a id="p-s-343"   class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover"   data-content="Schonfeld case, p. 70."><sup>5351</sup></a>

<p id="p-s-345">
These examples mentioned by the Judge Advocate suggest that the accused’s presence in the vicinity (moral encouragement as opposed to tangible support) could constitute the actus reus of aiding and abetting liability if it has the effect of giving additional confidence to the principal perpetrator, and that the purpose of the accused’s act, together with the principal perpetrator’s knowledge thereof, could be considered as potentially relevant evidence in this evaluation.<a id="p-s-346"   class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover"   data-content="See also Furundžija Trial Judgement, paras 200-202, 239."><sup>5352</sup></a>

Thus, the convictions were based on each accused’s contribution demonstrated through his role – including in carrying

In light of the factual circumstances in this case, the Judge Advocate stated that “if people are all present, aiding and abetting one another to carry out a crime they knew was going to be committed, they are taking their respective parts in carrying it out, whether it be to shoot or whether it is to keep off other people or act as an escort  … , they are all in law equally guilty of committing that offence”.<a id="p-s-356"   class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover"   data-content="Stalag Luft III case, pp. 43-44, recording that the Judge Advocate also noted that “their individual responsibility with regard to punishment may vary.”"><sup>5360</sup></a>
In explaining the term “concerned in the killing”, he further stated:
</p>

<div id="p-s-357" class="row">

<div id="p-s-359" class="col-md-10"><p id="p-s-360"><small>

I do not think that the prosecution can ask you to consider a case of a minor official who was concerned with some administrative matter. What they had in mind is that the persons concerned must have been part of the machine doing some duty, carrying out some performance which went on directly to achieve the killing, that it had some real bearing on the killing, would not have been so effective or been done so expeditiously  if that person had not contributed his willing aid.<a id="p-s-361"   class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover"   data-content="Stalag Luft III case, p. 46 (emphasis added)."><sup>5361</sup></a>

<div id="p-s-362" class="col-md-1"></div>

<p id="p-s-363">
This suggests that, in addition to the knowledge of a defendant, the important question to be asked was whether the concerned act “had some real bearing on the killing”, i.e. had a substantial effect on the killing, and that this is what the Judge Advocate meant when he used the expression “performance which went on directly to achieve the killing”. This observation is further supported by the court’s focus on: (i) what part each defendant played in the shooting of the prisoners, which showed the degree of his contribution to the commission of the crimes; and (ii) whether it was a
knowing participation.<a id="p-s-364"   class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover"   data-content="Stalag Luft III case, pp. 40-44, 51. With regard to the knowledge, the court examined whether the defendants knew that the victims were prisoners of war, and even if not, whether they knew that the execution was unlawful due to the lack of meaningful trials (see ibid., pp. 40, 51).

The offence is committed only if, by giving information, the informer becomes a party to, or accomplice in, a war crime recognized as such in international law. This condition is fulfilled if circumstances constituting complicity are present, e.g., if the informer knew that his action would lead to the commission of a war crime and either intended to bring about this consequence or was recklessly indifferent with regard to it.

Interpreting Article II(2) of Control Council Law No. 10, the court stated that, for a finding of guilt with regard to a crime against humanity under Control Council Law No. 10, it was not necessary to determine the form of liability under German criminal law (see Pig-cart parade case, p. 231). The court did, however, apply aiding and abetting liability for the remaining crimes charged under German criminal law."><sup>5368</sup></a>
The court found that L, G, and S caused in part what the two victims suffered: (i) L got hold of the pig truck; (ii) G led the marching band and accompanied the demonstration; and (iii) S accompanied the pig truck wearing his uniform and carrying a rifle.<a id="p-s-373"   class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover"   data-content="Pig-cart parade case, p. 232."><sup>5369</sup></a>
It found that the three accused were old Nazi officials and that it was inconceivable that they were not at least aware of the risk of people being assaulted by a system of violence and injustice and accepted such an outcome by reconciling themselves with it (dolus eventualis).

Therefore, the convictions and acquittal were based on whether the defendants contributed to the commission of the crime and whether the mens rea met the dolus eventualis standard.<a id="p-s-377"   class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover"   data-content="The Appeals Chamber is of the view that the Hechingen Deportation case before German courts cited in the Furundžia Trial Judgement is not informative for the present analysis (see Furundžija Trial Judgement, paras 224-225). The court of first instance convicted the accused based on aiding and abetting liability. However, the court of appeal applied a different mens rea standard required for a principal (Täter) rather than for an aider or abettor (Gehilfe), interpreting Article II(2) of Control Council Law No. 10 as not distinguishing between perpetration (Täterschaft) and accessoryship/complicity (Teilnahme) (see Landgericht Hechingen, 28.6.1947, KLs 23/47 and Oberlandesgericht Tübingen, 20.1.1948, Ss 54/47, decision on appeal reported in Justiz und NS-Verbrechen, vol. I, pp. 469-502, in particular, p. 498). As a result, the court of appeal quashed the convictions of some of the defendants (see ibid., p. 499). The Appeals Chamber considers that Article II(2) of Control Council Law No. 10 does distinguish various forms of liability. The Synagogue case before a German court cited in the Furundžija Trial Judgement is also not instructive for the purpose of identifying elements of aiding and abetting liability (see Furundžija Trial Judgement, paras 205-207), as this case addresses “Mittäterschaft”, namely the liability of a co-perpetrator (Mittäter), as opposed to “Beihilfe”, namely the liability of an aider and abettor (Gehilfe) (see Strafsenat, Urteil vom 10.

Ernst Roechling, who acted as the firm’s representative in France, was found guilty as an accessory to these  actions  by  Hermann  Roechling.  In  its  analysis  the  appellate  tribunal  focused  on  the importance of Ernst Roechling’s role in the economic plunder and spoliation in France as well as his knowledge of the significance of his own role and of Hermann Roechling’s activities. As a result, it overturned Ernst Roechling’s acquittal entered by the tribunal of first instance.<a id="p-s-381"   class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover"   data-content="Roechling case, p. 1119-1124, 1140.

The role which   Ernst Roechling   played in the enslavement of the French industry and in its systematic spoliation, was of great importance.”), p. 1120 (“ Ernst Roechling  was well aware of the fact that Hermann Roechling had set himself the task of increasing the war potential of the Reich, and that he assisted him voluntarily in this task in France”). With regard to his specific acts, see, e.g., ibid., p. 1120 (“It was Ernst Roechling who, as a result of his personal relations to the French Ministers  … , was able to effect this robbery”), p. 1123 (“It cannot be assumed that the administrator of a company (and Ernst Roechling held this office in the Société de Crédits et d’Investissements; he was indeed, together with Kreuter, its founder) which was formed for the purpose of committing criminal acts and whose activity consisted thereof, should be absolved of criminal responsibility because he played no specific part. He could only escape this responsibility by proving that he was only a pro forma administrator, had been deceived as to the true purpose of the company, and had known nothing of its operations. No such excuse  has  been put forward.  …  Ernst Roechling’s role in the operation of the so-called Lorsar purchasing office is of decisive importance, for he was the delegated administrator of this company.

<div id="p-s-384" class="row">
<div id="p-s-385" class="col-md-1"></div>
<div id="p-s-386" class="col-md-10"><p id="p-s-387"><small>


Hermann Roechling and the other accused members of the Directorate of the   firm   are not accused of having ordered this horrible treatment, but of having permitted it; and indeed supported it, and in addition, of not having done their utmost to put an end to these abuses. In adopting this attitude they permitted the continued existence and further development of this inhuman situation and thus, particularly through this tolerance, participated in the maltreatment within the meaning of Law No. 10.<a id="p-s-388"   class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover"   data-content="Roechling case, p. 1136."><sup>5378</sup></a>

<div id="p-s-389" class="col-md-1"></div>
</div>

<p id="p-s-390">
The appellate tribunal’s analysis thereby focused on the positions and powers of the above- mentioned three defendants which provided them with sufficient authority to intervene and improve the treatment of the deported workers who were subject to the terrible conditions that were known or must have been known to these defendants.<a id="p-s-391"   class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover"   data-content="Roechling case, pp. 1134, 1136-1137. In particular, the appellate tribunal rejected the assertion of Von Gemmingen- Hornberg and Rodenhauser that the material conditions of the workers were dependent on the “German Labour Front” and disciplinary matters on the “Gestapo” and found that, despite having sufficient authority, these two defendants failed to intervene in order to improve the conditions of the workers disciplined and detained in a camp (see ibid., pp. 1136-1137). In contrast, the appellate tribunal confirmed the acquittals of Ernst Roechling and Albert Maier with respect to the deportation and ill-treatment of the workers, stating that “ a s a result of the positions they held,  they were not connected with manpower matters, and their conduct can therefore not be considered as participation in these abuses” (see ibid., p. 1136)."><sup>5379</sup></a>
Accordingly, the Appeals Chamber observes that, in the Roechling case, the essential consideration in determining accessorial or accomplice liability was  the  impact  that  each  defendant  could  exert  on  the  principal’s offences  as  well  as  their awareness thereof.

<p id="p-s-392">1635.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Applying  Control  Council  Law  No. 10,  the  US  military  tribunals  in  Nuremberg  also similarly focused on: (i) the degree of each defendant’s contribution to the commission of the crimes, evinced through the part each defendant played and the effect of his conduct on the crimes; and (ii) the knowledge that each defendant had. </p>

  Additionally,  in  relation  to  defendant  Graf,  a  member  of Einsatzkommando 6, the tribunal held that while he knew of some of the executions, “more than mere knowledge of illegality of crime is required in order to establish guilt”.<a id="p-s-396"   class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover"   data-content="Einsatzgruppen case, p. 585, also finding that “in view of his various absences from the Kommando it cannot be assumed that his membership in the organization of itself proves his presence at and knowledge of any particular executive operation, without there being proof of that fact.”"><sup>5383</sup></a>
  The tribunal further opined that “ s ince there is no evidence in the record that Graf was at any time in a position to protest against the illegal actions of others, he cannot be found guilty as an accessory  to crimes against humanity and war crimes .”<a id="p-s-397"   class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover"   data-content="Einsatzgruppen case, p. 585 also finding that “ s ince there is no proof that he personally participated in any of the executions or their planning, he may not be held as a principal.”"><sup>5384</sup></a>
  In contrast, with respect to defendant Klingelhoefer, who was in charge of various units and later an interpreter with Einsatzgruppe B, the tribunal held that, even if his functions had been limited to that of an interpreter, “it would not exonerate him from

guilt because in locating, evaluating and turning over lists of Communist party functionaries to the executive department of his organization he was aware that the people listed would be executed when found” and that, “ i n this function, therefore, he served as an accessory to the crime.”<a id="p-s-398"   class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover"   data-content="Einsatzgruppen case, p. 569.

The tribunal concluded that while the evidence did not conclusively establish that Fendler “was guilty of planning the killing of people or ordering their death”, it did show that he took a “consenting part in the criminal activities” (ibid., p. 573). See also the tribunals’ findings on defendant Seibert, who was found to have “participated as a principal as well as an accessory in  the operations of Einsatzgruppe D  which violated international law” (ibid., pp. 536-539) as well as defendant von Radetzky, who was found to have taken “a consenting part” in the executions of Jews (ibid., pp. 576-578)."><sup>5387</sup></a>

<p id="p-s-401">1637.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Furund`ija trial chamber observed, the above findings in the Einsatzgruppen case indicate that “knowledge of the criminal activities of the organisation combined with a role in that organisation was not sufficient”.<a id="p-s-402"   class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover"   data-content="Furund`ija Trial Judgement, para. 221."><sup>5388</sup></a>

One who knowingly by his influence and money contributes to the support  of an organisation which on a large scale is responsible for war crimes and crimes against humanity  must, under settled legal  principles, be  deemed to  be,  if  not  a  principal, certainly an  accessory to  such
crimes.<a id="p-s-411"   class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover"   data-content="Flick case, p. 1217."><sup>5392</sup></a>

<p id="p-s-413">1639.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tribunal found that Steinbrinck could not have remained wholly ignorant of the criminal activities of the SS under the administration of Himmler.<a id="p-s-414"   class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover"   data-content="Flick case, p. 1217"><sup>5393</sup></a>
It further found that Flick and Steinbrinck became members of the Himmler Circle of Friends<a id="p-s-415"   class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover"   data-content="Flick case, pp. 1217-1218, also finding that while there was no evidence that during the meetings of the Circle the criminal activities of the SS were discussed, the defendants were aware that Himmler was Reich Leader SS."><sup>5394</sup></a>
and that members of the Circle were called upon to contribute money to Himmler and were informed that the money was “to be
spent for some of  Himmler’s  cultural hobbies and for emergencies for which he had no appropriations.”<a id="p-s-416"   class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover"   data-content="Flick case, p. 1219."><sup>5395</sup></a>
Flick and Steinbrinck each had to contribute annually 100,000 Reichsmarks and, through a special fund of a bank, this money went into a second bank account upon which Himmler’s personal adjutant drew checks. The tribunal held that none of the defendants knew of the “specific purpose” of the checks.<a id="p-s-417"   class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover"   data-content="Flick case, p. 1220."><sup>5396</sup></a>
It further held:

<div id="p-s-420" class="col-md-10"><p id="p-s-421"><small>

Nor did the prosecution show that any part of the money was directly used for the criminal activities of the SS. It is reasonably clear that some of the funds were used purely for cultural purposes. But during the war and particularly after the beginning of the Russian campaign we cannot  believe  that  there  was  much  cultural  activity  in  Germany.  A  hundred  thousand Reichsmarks even to a wealthy man was not then a trifling but a substantial contribution. Ten times that sum annually was placed in the hands of Himmler, the Reich Leader SS, for his personal use and was continued year after year without a thought on  the part of the defendants , according to their testimony, that any portion of it might be used by him to maintain the organization of which he was the head. It is a strain upon credulity to believe that he needed or spent annually a million Reichsmarks solely for cultural purposes or that members of the Circle could reasonably believe that he did.</small></p>

<p id="p-s-422"><small>
…  It remains clear from the evidence that each of them gave to Himmler, the Reich Leader SS, a blank check. His criminal organization was maintained and we have no doubt that some of this money went to its maintenance. It seems to be immaterial whether it was spent on salaries or for lethal gas.<a id="p-s-423"   class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover"   data-content="Flick case, pp. 1220-1221."><sup>5397</sup></a>

<p id="p-s-425">1640.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The convictions were therefore based on the defendants’ substantial contribution to and knowledge  of  criminal  activities.  It  was  not  additionally  required  that  the  contribution  be specifically directed to criminal activities.

<p id="p-s-426">1641.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This approach was also taken in the Justice case.<a id="p-s-427"   class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover"   data-content="United   States   of   America  v.

The tribunal found that defendant

Rothenberger, president of the District Court of Appeals in Hamburg and later Under Secretary in


the Ministry of Justice, was “instrumental” in denying Jews their fair trial rights.<a id="p-s-428"   class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover"   data-content="Justice case, p. 1118. More specifically, the tribunal found that Rothenberger: (i) used his influence over judges to protect party members who had been charged or convicted of crimes; (ii) participated in securing the enactment of a discriminatory law against Jews; and (iii) enforced the law and, before its enactment, acted upon his own initiative and without legal authority in  denying Jews right to  proceed in civil litigation without advancement of  costs (ibid., pp. 1110-1114). The tribunal also found that he “used his influence towards achieving discriminatory action favorable to high party officials and unfavorable to Poles and Jews” (see ibid., p. 1118)."><sup>5399</sup></a>
The tribunal found that, while this appeared to be a “small matter compared to the extermination of Jews by the millions under other procedures”, it was “nevertheless a part of the government-organized plan for the persecution of the Jews, not only by murder and imprisonment but by depriving them of the means of livelihood and of equal rights in the courts of law.”<a id="p-s-429"   class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover"   data-content="Justice case, p. 1114."><sup>5400</sup></a>
The tribunal further found that Rothenberger must have known that the inmates of the Mauthausen concentration camp were there either without trial, following acquittal, or after the expiration of their term of imprisonment.<a id="p-s-430"   class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover"   data-content="Justice case, p. 1116. The tribunal also found that he “thought concentration camps wrong but concluded that they were not objectionable if third degree methods did not become a habit” (ibid., p. 1118)."><sup>5401</sup></a>

Thus he was aware of the system of “protective custody”<a id="p-s-431"   class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover"   data-content="Justice case, pp. 1116-1117. According to the tribunal, in Hitler’s decree of Night and Fog, “civilians of occupied counties accused of alleged crimes in resistance activities against German occupying forces were spirited away for secret trial by special courts of the Ministry of Justice within the Reich   … . If the accused was acquitted, or if convicted, after serving his sentence, he was handed over to Gestapo for ‘protective custody’ for the duration of the war. These proceedings resulted in the torture, ill treatment, and murder of thousands of persons” (ibid., pp. 1031-1032)."><sup>5402</sup></a>

He aided and abetted in the program of racial persecution, and notwithstanding his many protestations to the contrary he materially contributed toward the prostitution of the Ministry of Justice and the courts and their subordination to the arbitrary will of Hitler, the Party minions, and the police.

The tribunal found that the evidence was insufficient to establish that they knew that the gas was to be used for criminal purposes (see ibid., pp. 1168-1169). This is consistent with the Zyklon B case in which the British military court found two defendants guilty since it found, based on the evidence particular to this case, they knew of the unlawful use of poison gas “Zyklon B” and had influence over the supply of the gas (see Zyklon B case, pp. 94-102).

The tribunal found that he had no part in the actual extermination of the Jews, but he “was a consenting participant in part of the execution of the entire plan, although his participation was not a major one”; defendant Rasche, see ibid., pp. 621-622, 784, in which, in relation to the loans made by the Dresdner Bank to Reich spoliation agencies as well as various SS enterprises which employed slave labour and were engaged in the resettlement program, the tribunal found that Rasche, spokesman of the board of directors of the Bank, knew the purpose for which the loans were sought and how the money was to be used. However, the tribunal acquitted him of the charges stating that “ l oans or sale of commodities to be used in an unlawful enterprise  …  can hardly be said to be a crime.” With regard to the bank’s contributions (i.e. donations, as opposed to loans) to a fund placed at Himmler’s personal disposal, the tribunal concluded that the evidence did not show that Rasche knew that any part of the fund was intended to be or was ever used by Himmler for any unlawful purposes; defendant Stuckart, see ibid., pp. 645-646; defendant Schwerin von Krosigk, see ibid., pp. 672, 676-680, in which the tribunal found that as Minister of Finance, he “was fully aware that measures to which he put his name and programs in which he played a part were contrary and abhorrent to what he   …   knew to be right”. The tribunal found him criminally responsible as he “actively and consciously participated in the crimes”, i.e. the confiscation of Jewish property. By contrast, the tribunal found: “As Minister of Finance the defendant furnished the means by which the concentration camps were purchased, constructed, and maintained, but it is clear that he neither originated nor planned these matters  … . They were Reich funds  …  and he had no discretion with respect to their disposition. His act in distributing them for these purposes was actually clerical, and we cannot charge him with criminal responsibility in this matter”; defendant Lammers, see pp. 701, 706, 708-715, in which the tribunal found him guilty of taking part in plunder and spoliation, as he knew of acts of spoliation and gave “vital and extremely important assistance   …   in translating into law the various programs”; defendant Koerner, see ibid., pp. 826-828, 832; defendant Pleiger, see ibid., pp. 832-833, 843-844. United States of America v. Oswald Pohl et al., Opinion and Judgment of the United States Military Tribunal II, 3 November 1947, in Trials before NMTs, vol. V (“Pohl case”) – This case dealt with officials of the Economic and Administrative Main Office (“WVHA”) of the SS and the Action Reinhardt involving the confiscation of property from concentration camp inmates. Concerning defendant Pohl, see Pohl case, pp. 988-989, in which the tribunal found: “The fact that Pohl  head of the WVHA  himself did not actually transport the stolen goods to the Reich or did not himself remove the gold from the teeth of the dead inmates, does not exculpate him. This was a broad criminal program, requiring the cooperation of many persons, and Pohl’s part was to conserve and account for the loot. Having knowledge of the illegal purposes of the action and of the crimes which accompanied it, his active participation even in the after-phases of the action make him particeps criminis in the whole affair”; defendant Frank, see ibid., pp. 993-995, 997, in which the tribunal held that he “must conclusively be convicted of knowledge of and active and direct participation in the slave labor program”. In relation  to  Frank’s  alleged  responsibility  for  the  extermination  of  Jews  in  the  concentration  camps  and  Action Reinhardt,  the  tribunal  held:  “Assuming that  Frank  ultimately  heard  of  the  extermination measures,   …    a ny participation of Frank’s was post facto participation and was confined entirely to the distribution of property previously seized by others. Unquestionably this makes him a participant in the criminal conversion of the chattels, but not in the murders which preceded the confiscation. We therefore cannot find  …  that the defendant Frank is in law guilty of the murders of the Jews in the concentration camps, but we do find that he was guilty of participating and taking a consenting part in the wholesale looting”; defendant Fanslau, see ibid., pp. 998-999; defendant Hans Loerner, see ibid., pp. 999-1001, in which the tribunal found that, as chief of the office of budgets dealing, inter alia, with the financing and payrolls of SS personnel at concentration camps, he had “vital and important functions within the structure of the WVHA in connection with its administration of the concentration camps”, “was more than a mere bookkeeper”, “exercised discretion and judgment and made important decisions, many of which related directly to the procurement and operation of concentration camps.” “By reason of his direct and intimate association with this program”, the tribunal found him guilty of war crimes and crimes against humanity”; defendant Vogt, see ibid., pp. 1002-1004, in which the tribunal observed that, to establish that he “took a consenting part in and was connected with” a crime, “something more than having knowledge of” a crime is required and that “ t here is “an element of positive conduct implicit in the word ‘consent’”. The tribunal added that “ i n the case of a person who had power or authority to either start or stop a criminal act, knowledge of the fact coupled with silence could be interpreted as consent.” It acquitted Vogt on the ground, inter alia, that as chief of the office of audits in the WVHA, “ h is sole task was to inspect and analyze the records (which others had made) of past transactions” and that he did not furnish men, money, materials, or victims for the concentration camps, and had no role in determining what the inmates should wear, how hard they should work, or how they should be treated. The tribunal also found other than being aware of the existence of concentration camps, Vogt had no knowledge of what the inmates ate, wore, how they worked or were treated; defendant Georg Loerner, see ibid., pp. 1004-1105, 1007-1008; defendant Kiefer, see ibid., pp. 1020-1023; defendant Pook, see ibid., pp. 1036-1040."><sup>5405</sup></a>
“specific direction” was not required as an element of any form of accessorial liability.

The same holds true in the findings of the International Military Tribunal.<a id="p-s-441"   class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover"   data-content="Trial of the Major War Criminals before the International Military Tribunal, Nuremberg, 14 November 1945-1 October 1946 (“IMT Judgement”). See, in particular, its findings concerning defendant von Schirach in ibid., pp. 317, 319-320; defendant Speer in ibid., pp. 330-332; defendant Funk in ibid., pp. 304-307. According to Article 6 (a) to (c) of the IMT Charter, the following crimes were within the jurisdiction of the IMT: crimes against peace, war crimes, and crimes against humanity. Article 6(a) of the IMT Charter articulated “participation in a Common Plan or Conspiracy” to wage a war of aggression as a punishable act. Article 6 of the IMT Charter further provided that “ l eaders, organizers, instigators and accomplices participating in the formulation or execution of a Common Plan or Conspiracy to commit any of the foregoing crimes are responsible for all acts performed by any persons in execution of such plan.” The indictment charged not only the conspiracy or common plan to commit aggressive war but also to commit war crimes and crimes against humanity. However, the IMT concluded that as the IMT Charter “does not define as a separate crime any conspiracy except the one to commit acts of aggressive war”, it would “disregard the charges   …   that the defendants conspired to commit  war crimes and crimes against humanity , and  would  consider only the common plan to prepare, initiate, and wage aggressive war” (see IMT Judgement, p. 226). Accordingly, it appears that its findings on individual criminal responsibility in relation to war crimes and crimes against humanity relied on other forms of responsibility than conspiracy or common plan liability, such as possibly in some cases accomplice liability. Article 5 of the Charter of the International Military Tribunal for the Far East (“IMTFE”) of 19 January 1946 mirrors Article 6 of the IMT Charter. In light of the nature of the charges against the IMTFE defendants (see, in particular, count 54) as well as the limited reasoning provided in the judgement of the IMTFE, it is unclear, if not unlikely, that the mode of liability of aiding and abetting was necessarily considered and or applied in these cases. See generally International Military Tribunal for the Far East, Judgment of 12 November 1948, in R. John Pritchard ed., The Tokyo Major War Crimes Trial: The Records of the International Military Tribunal for the Far East with an Authoritative Commentary and Comprehensive Guide (New York: The Edwin Mellen Press, 1998), vol. 103, pp. 49,770-49,851."><sup>5406</sup></a>
The criteria employed in these cases were rather whether the defendants substantially and knowingly contributed to relevant crimes.

<p id="p-s-442">1643.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Appeals Chamber now turns to national law on the elements of aiding and abetting liability. At the outset, the Appeals Chamber recalls that under the doctrine of general principles of law recognised by nations, national legislation and case law may be relied upon as a source of international principles or rules in limited situations. Such reliance, however, is permissible only where it is shown that most, if not all, countries accept and adopt the same approach to the notion at
issue.<a id="p-s-443"   class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover"   data-content="See Tadić Appeal Judgement, para. 225. See also Taylor Appeal Judgement, paras 429, 447."><sup>5407</sup></a>
More specifically, it would be necessary to show that the major legal systems of the world
take the same approach to that notion.<a id="p-s-444"   class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover"   data-content="See Tadić Appeal Judgement, para. 225."><sup>5408</sup></a>
</p>


<p id="p-s-445">1644.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having conducted a review of national law, the Appeals Chamber considers that this is not the case with respect to the notion of “specific direction”. Specifically, in light of the variation
among national jurisdictions with respect to aiding and abetting liability, the Appeals Chamber

considers that no clear common principle in this respect can be gleaned from the major legal systems of the world. As a common basis, for aiding and abetting liability to arise, national legislation and the jurisprudence of domestic courts require the provision of assistance or support which facilitates the commission of a crime. However, national jurisdictions conceptualise the link between the acts of assistance and the crime in the context of actus reus and the required degree of mens  rea  in  various  different  ways  in  accordance  with  principles  in  their  respective  legal
systems.<a id="p-s-446"   class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover"   data-content="Article 13(VI) of the Federal Criminal Code of Mexico provides that a participant in the offence is a person who “wilfully”  dolosamente  aids or abets another person in the commission of that offence. The Supreme Court of Justice has held that the accomplice “is an efficient assistant aware of the plans and conduct of the material perpetrator, instigator or necessary co-perpetrator (the accomplice’s intervention is required for the commission of the crime), who contributes to the crime by means of the previous or simultaneous use of means for its commission, but who does not have control over the crime” (Suprema Corte de Justicia de la Nación, Tesis CXXI/2007, vol. XXV, June 2007, p. 208; and Contradicción de Tesis 414/2010, vol. VIII, May 2012, p. 975). Section 107 of the Indian  Penal Code stipulates that a person abets, inter alia,  by “intentionally aid ing , by any act or illegal omission”. The Penal Code further explains that “ w hoever, either prior to or at the time of the commission of an act, does anything in order to facilitate the commission of that act, and thereby facilitate the commission thereof, is said to aid the doing of that act” (Indian Penal Code, Section 107, Explanation 2). Therefore, in order to constitute abetment by aiding within the meaning of Section 107 of the Indian Penal Code, the abettor must be shown to have intentionally aided the commission of the offence (Ratanlal Ranchhoddas and Dhirajlal Keshavlal Thakore, The Indian Penal Code: Act XLV of 1860: with exhaustive notes, comments, case-law references, State Amendments along with Schedule of Classification of Offences and Forms as prescribed under Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, 28th Edition (New Delhi: Wadhwa and Company, 1997), p. 136). The Penal Codes of Singapore and Malaysia contain provisions mirroring Section 107 of the Indian Penal Code (see Singaporean Penal Code, Section 107; Malaysian Penal Code, Section 107). Article 29 of the Criminal Code of Cambodia defines an accomplice as “the person who intentionally facilitates the attempt or the realization of a felony or a misdemeanor by providing his/her help or assistance”. According to Article 56 of the Penal Code of Indonesia, an accomplice is a person who either deliberately aids the commission of the crime or deliberately provides opportunity, means or information for its commission. Article 20 of the Penal Code of Vietnam identifies “helpers” as those “who create spiritual or material conditions for the commission of crimes.” Article 17 of the Penal Code of Laos recognises “accomplices” as those “who have intentionally assisted in the offence, or who have previously agreed to hide the offender, to hide instruments and tools of the offence, to efface traces of the offence or to conceal any proceeds from the offence.” The High Court of Hong Kong has confirmed that: “the fact that a person was voluntarily and purposely present witnessing the commission of a crime, and offered no opposition to it, though he might reasonably be expected to prevent and had the power so to do, or at least to express his dissent, might, under some circumstances, afford cogent evidence upon which a jury would be justified in finding that he wilfully encouraged and so aided and abetted.  … . To find a person guilty as an aider and abettor it is not only necessary to prove that he was present while the offence is committed, that he knew an offence was being committed and that his presence, in fact, gave encouragement to the perpetrators but it must be proved that he intended to give that encouragement, that he  wilfully encouraged.” (R. v. Lam Kit  1988  1 HKC 679, pp. 2-3 (emphasis in the original)). Article 66(1)(b) of the Crimes Act 1961 of New Zealand  provides that a person is a party to and guilty of an offence if that person “does or omits an act for the purpose of aiding any person to commit the offence”. The Supreme Court of New Zealand has held that aiding and  abetting  requires  that  “the  secondary  party  intentionally  helped  or  encouraged  the  principal  offender  with knowledge of the essential matters constituting the offence, including the principal’s mens rea” (Mahana Makarini Edmonds v. R  2011  NZSC 159, para. 22). In South Africa, accomplice liability requires that the person has “intentionally furthered or assisted in the commission of the crime”. In this regard, dolus eventual is would suffice. In addition, “the accused must also know or foresee the possibility that his or her conduct is unlawful” (Jonathan Burchell and John Milton, Principles of Criminal Law, 3rd Edition (Juta and Company Ltd., 2005), pp. 604-605. See also ibid., pp. 600-603). In Tladi v. S, the Free State High Court has held that the accomplice’s “assistance may be of a negligible nature but what is required is that it must be proven that there was adequate assistance” (Tladi v. S  2005  ZAFSHC 143, p. 3)."><sup>5409</sup></a>

<p id="p-s-447"> 1645.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For instance, in some civil law countries, such as France,<a id="p-s-448"   class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover"   data-content="Article 121-7 of the French Penal Code provides that “the person who knowingly, by aiding and abetting, facilitates its preparation or commission” is an “accomplice to a felony or a misdemeanour”. (« est complice d'un crime ou d'un délit la personne qui sciemment, par aide ou assistance, en a facilité la préparation ou la consommation. »). (English translation is available at:  http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/.) More specifically, for an accused to be convicted as an accomplice to a criminal offence by aiding and abetting (aide ou assistance), it must be established that: (i) the act of aiding and abetting happened before or at the same time as the perpetration of the criminal act (Arrêt de la chambre criminelle de la Cour de cassation (“Crim.”), 23 July 1927: Recueil Sirey, 1929. 1. 73) and was a positive act (which could  be   moral  encouragement  through  the   presence)  rather   than  a   simple  inaction  or   omission  (Crim., 21 October 1948:  Bulletin  des  arrêt  de  la  chambre  criminelle  de  la  Cour  de  cassation  (“Bull.  crim.”),  no 242, 27 December 1960 and ibid., no  624 ; Crim., 26 March 1992: Droit pénal Dalloz 1992. 194); and (ii) the accomplice aided or abetted the principal perpetrator with the awareness of the assistance he provided in the commission of the offence by the principal perpetrator (« De même, la question de complicité par aide ou assistance doit préciser que l'aide ou l'assistance a été prêtée avec connaissance. » Crim., 19 March 1986: Bull. crim., no 112; « La complicité par aide et assistance prévue par l'al. 1er de l'art. 121-7 C. pén. n'est punissable que si cette aide a été apportée sciemment à l'auteur principal dans les faits qui ont facilité la préparation  ou la consommation de l'infraction. » Crim., 19 June 2001: Bull. crim., no 148; Droit pénal Dalloz 2001. 111; « L'élément intentionnel du délit de complicité exige seulement que son auteur ait eu conscience de l'aide apportée à l'action principale. » Crim., 1 October 1984: Gazette du Palais 1985, Sommaires 96; « Est complice d'un crime ou d'un délit la personne qui sciemment, par aide ou assistance, en a facilité la  préparation  ou la  consommation; ne peut servir  de base  à  une condamnation une question qui laisse incertain le point de savoir si l'aide ou l'assistance ont été prêtées en connaissance de cause. » Crim., 28 June 1995: Bull. crim., no  241; Droit pénal Dalloz 1995. 274).

(« Seront punis comme complices d'un crime ou d'un délit: …ceux qui auront procuré des armes, des instruments, ou tout autre moyen qui a servi au crime ou au délit, sachant qu'ils devaient y servir; ceux qui, hors le cas prévu par le § 3 de l'article 66, auront, avec connaissance, aidé ou assisté l'auteur ou les auteurs du crime ou du délit dans les faits qui l'ont préparé ou facilité, ou dans ceux qui l'ont consommé. »). The Belgian Court of Cassation held : « Afin de constater que les demandeurs ont commis les faits en tant que complices, il est requis mais il suffit qu’il soit établi qu'ils ont coopéré sciemment à la commission de l'infraction, de la manière prévue par la loi. » Arrêt de la Cour de cassation de Belgique (Cass.), 28 September 2010, AR P.10.0099.N, Pasicrisie belge (Pas.), 2010, no 554. See also Christine Hennau and Jacques Verhaegen, Droit pénal general, 3rd  Edition (Bruxelles: Bruylant, 2003), pp. 278-286, explaining that, to establish the aiding and abetting liability, the following elements have to be fulfilled: (i) the material realisation of the principal offence or its attempt; (ii) direct or indirect, but certain causation between the act of assistance and the commission of the principal offence or its attempt (in the sense that the offence belongs to the logical sequence of the assistance provided); and (iii) “intention coupable (dolus)”, i.e. mens rea, to participate in the commission of the principal offence, in the sense that the aider or abettor was aware of the essential elements of the crime and was willing, or at least accepted that the crime be committed. Moreover, in Luxembourg, Article 67 of Luxembourgian Penal Code mirrors Article 67 of the Belgian Penal Code. The Luxembourgian Court of Cassation held that, for Article 67 to apply, the law requires that the supplier of instruments for a crime should have known that in providing them, they were to be used for the specific crime charged, this special knowledge forming the criminal link between the accomplice and the perpetrator. (« …pour que l’Article 67 soit applicable,…la loi exige qu’il ait su, en les fournissant,  qui’ils devaient server au crime déterminé qui fait l’objet de l’accusation, cette connaissance spéciale formant le lien criminel qui unit le  complice à  l’auteur. »)  See  Dean Spielmann and  Alphonse Spielmann, Droit  pénal  général  Luxembourgeois, 2nd Edition (Bruxelles: Bruylant, 2004), p. 350, quoting la Cour Supérieure de Justice (Cour d'appel siégeant en matière correctionnelle), 24 March 1986, no  7/86 VI, and Tribunal d'arrondissement de Luxembourg, 26 November 1987, no 1678/86, cités dans Pasicrisie luxembourgeoise, XXVII, (Sommaires), 93, no 18."><sup>5411</sup></a> and Algeria,<a id="p-s-450"   class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover"   data-content="In Algeria, Article 42 of the Algerian Penal Code provides that those who knowingly aided by all means or assisted the perpetrator(s) of a criminal offence in its preparation or commission, without directly participating in that offence, shall be considered as accomplices to the criminal offence (« Sont considérés comme complices d’une infraction ceux qui, sans participation directe à cette infraction, ont, avec connaissance, aidé par tous moyens ou assisté l’auteur ou les auteurs de l’action dans les faits qui l’ont préparée  ou facilitée, ou qui l’ont consommée. »). Article 43 of the same code further provides that accomplices are those who, being aware of their criminal conduct, usually provided housing, place of retreat or meeting for one or more criminals engaged in robbery or violence against the security of the State, the  public  peace,  the  people  or  the  properties (« Est  assimilé  au  complice celui  qui,  connaissant  leur  conduit criminelle, a habituellement fourni logement, lieu de retraite ou de réunions à un ou plusieurs malfaiteurs exerçant des brigandages ou des violences contre la sûreté de l’Etat, la paix publique, les personnes ou les propriétés. »). There are also a number of other countries whose Penal Codes contain provisions which closely resemble the above mentioned provisions of the French, Belgian, and Algerian Penal Codes and thereby provide the equivalent definition of aiding and abetting liability. See Moroccan  Penal Code, Article 129; Senegalese  Penal Code, Articles 46-47; Tunisian  Penal Code, Article 32; Madagascan Penal Code, Articles 60-61; Mauritanian Penal Code, Articles 54-55; Burundian Penal Code, Article 38; Penal Code of the Democratic Republic of Congo, Article 22; Malian Penal Code, Article 24."><sup>5412</sup></a> it is required that the aider or abettor provided assistance to the principal perpetrator and thereby facilitated the commission of the crime by that principal perpetrator, with the awareness that his act would provide assistance to the commission of the crime. In other countries of civil law tradition, such as Germany,<a id="p-s-451"   class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover"   data-content="In Germany, any person who intentionally assists another in the intentional commission of an unlawful act shall be punished as an aider (Art. 27 (I) of the German Criminal Code reads: “Als Gehilfe wird bestraft, wer vorsätzlich einem anderen zu dessen vorsätzlich begangener rechtswidriger Haupttat Hilfe geleistet hat”). The assistance does not need to be conditio sine qua non for the commission of the crime; it is sufficient that the act of the aider and abettor has facilitated it. (Tröndle/Fischer, Strafgesetzbuch und Nebengesetze, 53. Auflage, München 2006, § 27, Anm. 2 c with references) As to the mens rea, it is required that the aider and abettor was at least aware of the risk of the commission of the crime and accepts such an outcome by reconciling himself with it (dolus eventualis). An exception from the dolus eventualis requirement has been found in cases of so-called “professional” or “neutral” acts, where it has been held that if the acts of the principal are exclusively targeted toward committing a crime and the person providing assistance knows this with certainty (positiv weiß), the person will be punished as aider and abettor. (Tröndle/Fischer, Strafgesetzbuch und Nebengesetze, 53. Auflage, München 2006, § 27, Anm. 2 b with references; BGH NStZ 2001, 364)."><sup>5413</sup></a> Bulgaria,<a id="p-s-452"   class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover"   data-content="Article 20(4) of the Criminal Code of Bulgaria provides that the aider is a person who has “intentionally facilitated the commission of a crime through advice, explanations, promises to render assistance after the act, removal of obstacles, supply of means or in any other way.” The actus reus of aiding involves the creation of conditions which to a certain degree facilitate the commission of the crime (Aleksandar Stoynov, Criminal Law: General Part (Sofia: Ciela, 1999), p. 316). The mens rea of aiding requires that the aider foresee the commission of the crime and its consequences and is aware that his conduct facilitates the perpetrator. In terms of volition, the aider either aims at or agrees with the facilitation and with the commission of the crime, either wanting or accepting its consequences (ibid., p. 317)."><sup>5414</sup></a> China,<a id="p-s-453"   class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover"   data-content="In China, Article 27 of the Penal Code of the People’s Republic of China provides that “an accomplice refers to any person   who   plays   a   secondary   or   auxiliary   role   in   a   joint   crime.”   (English   translation   available   at http://www.npc.gov.cn/englishnpc/Law/2007-12/13/content_1384075.htm). In both criminal law theories and jurisprudence, there exist a more specific category of actors that are named as aiders and abettors, which refer to those who with intent (dolus) provide aid or assistance to the principal perpetrator and facilitate his commission of the crime. To establish the liability of an aider and abettor, it is required that: (i) the accused was aware of the fact that he was aiding and abetting others in a crime, and intentionally created a more convenient condition for others’ commission of the crime or took the risk of the creation of such a condition; and (ii) the act of aiding and abetting was distinguishable from the act of perpetration and facilitated the perpetration of the crime. With respect to the mens rea, it is not required that the accused have any specific criminal intent or any intention pursuing the perpetration of the crime. With regard to the actus reus, tangible and intangible assistance and physical and moral support can all constitute aiding and abetting, as long as they contributed physically or mentally to the crime to a certain extent (Chen Xingliang, ed., Xingfa Zonglun Jingshi, (Beijing: People’s Court Press, 2010), pp. 524-527)."><sup>5415</sup></a> and Japan,<a id="p-s-454"   class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover"   data-content="In Japan, Article 62(1) of the Japanese Penal Code provides that “ a  person who aids a principal is an accessory.” The Japanese Supreme Court held that “ t he term ‘accessory’ as set forth in Article 62, paragraph (1) of the Penal Code refers to a person who aids another person by any tangible or intangible means with the intent  “ishi” in the Japanese original  of collaborating in such other person’s commission of a crime, thereby facilitating the person’s crime.” (2011 (A) No. 2249, decision of the Third Petty Bench of the Supreme Court of 15 April 2013, Keishu vol. 67, No. 4, referring to 1949 (Re) No. 1506, judgment of the Second Petty Bench of the Supreme Court of 1 October 1949, Keishu Vol. 3, No. 10, at 1629).

In addition, it must be established that he did so with the dolus, which is often translated in English as “intent” and encompasses either purpose, knowledge with certainty (dolus directus), or the awareness and acceptance of the likelihood that the crime could be committed and that his act could facilitate the commission of the crime (dolus eventualis). Dolus eventualis is the minimum requirement. In some common law countries, such as Australia and Canada, the aider and abettor must have both intent and knowledge, while the required amount of assistance in order for liability to arise, for the most part, is relatively low.<a id="p-s-455"   class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover"   data-content="In Australia in order for liability to attach the accused “must have in fact aided, abetted, counselled or procured” the commission of an offence which was committed and “must have intended that: (a) his or her conduct would aid, abet, counsel or procure the commission of any offence (including its fault elements) of the type the other person committed; or (b) his or her conduct would aid, abet, counsel or procure the commission of an offence and have been reckless about the commission of the offence (including its fault elements) that the other person in fact committed” (see Criminal Code Act 1995, Part 2. 4, Division 11.2). In relation to the actus reus, the accused “is in some way linked in purpose with the person actually committing the crime, and is by his words or conduct doing something to bring about, or rendering more likely, such commission” (R. v. Russell  1933   VLR 59, p. 67). Both knowledge of the essential facts of the principal offence and participation intentionally aimed at the commission of the act which constitutes that offence are required to render a person liable as an aider and abettor (see Giorgianni v. R.  1985 , 156 CLR 473, pp. 500, 503-507; see also ibid., p. 482). In Canada, a person who “does or omits to do anything for the purpose of aiding any person to commit” an offence is considered a party to that offence (see Criminal Code, RSC 1985, c. C-46, Article 21(1)(b)). The “actus reus of aiding or abetting is doing (or, in some circumstances, omitting to do) something that assists or encourages the perpetrator to commit the offence” (R. v. Briscoe  2010  1 S.C.R. 411, para. 14). The Supreme Court of Canada has held that the mens rea  requirement reflected in the word “purpose” includes both “intent” and “knowledge”. For the “intent” component, it has interpreted “purpose” to mean “intention” to assist the perpetrator in the commission of the crime, rather than “desire” that the offence be successfully committed. (R. v. Briscoe  2010  1 S.C.R. 411, paras 16-17; see also R. v. Hibbert  1995  2 S.C.R. 973, paras 31-32, 35-36, 40). In relation to the “knowledge” component, the Supreme Court has held that “in order to have the intention to assist in the commission of an offence, the aider must know that the perpetrator intends to commit the crime, although he or she need not know precisely how it will be committed” (R. v. Briscoe   2010   1 S.C.R. 411, para. 17). Reference to “purpose” is found also in Section 20(1) of the Criminal Code of Ghana  which stipulates that: “Every person who, directly or indirectly, instigates, commands, counsels, procures, solicits, or in any manner purposely aids, facilitates, encourages, or promotes, whether by his act or presence or otherwise, and every person who does any act for the purpose of aiding, facilitating, encouraging or promoting the commission of a crime by any other person, whether known or unknown, certain or uncertain, is guilty of abetting that crime, and of abetting the other person in respect of that crime.” Article 31 of the Israeli Penal Code defines an aider as a person who “before or during the commission of an offence, acted in order to allow, facilitate or secure the said commission, or to prevent the apprehension of its perpetrator, the discovery of the offence or its loot, or in order to contribute in any other way to the creation of conditions for the commission of the crime”. The Supreme Court of Israel has held that the actus reus of aiding consists of an act or omission that may assist, allow, facilitate or secure the realisation of the principal offence. There is no requirement that the assistance would be effective, that it would constitute a conditio sine qua non in relation to the principal offence, or that the commission of the latter was completed (Criminal Appeal 320/99, Plonit v. The State of Israel, PD 55(3) 22, paras 15-16). In relation to the mens rea, the aider must be aware of the essential elements of the principal offence and that his acts assist or otherwise allow the conditions for the commission of that offence (ibid., para. 17). In addition, the aider must have the purpose to assist the principal perpetrator. The latter requirement will be satisfied also if the aider is aware that his conduct would, in high probability, constitute an assisting contribution to the principal perpetrator (ibid., paras 19-20)."><sup>5417</sup></a>  In contrast, while English law also requires both intent and knowledge, the aider and abettor must make an essential contribution to the commission of the crime.<a id="p-s-456"   class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover"   data-content="In England,  in National Coal Board v. Gamble, Devlin J stated: “A person who supplies the instrument for a crime or anything essential to its commission aids in the commission of it; and if he does so knowingly and with intent to aid, he abets it as well and is therefore guilty of aiding and abetting.  ...  Another way of putting the point is to say that aiding and abetting is a crime that requires proof of mens rea, that is to say, of intention to aid as well as of knowledge of the circumstances, and that proof of the intent involves proof of a positive act of assistance voluntarily done.” (National Coal Board v. Gamble  1959  1 Q.B.11, p. 20; see also Maxwell v. Director of Public Prosecutions for Northern Ireland   1979  68 Cr. App. R. 128, pp. 140-141; R. v. Bryce  2004  2 Cr.App.R. 35, paras 42-45, 71, 75. See also R. v Bryce, para. 81 where the Court held that “all that is necessary in the secondary party is the foresight of the real possibility that an offence will be committed by the person to whom the accessory's acts of assistance are directed”)."><sup>5418</sup></a>  As to the United States, while there is a Model Penal Code, its approach to accomplice liability is not uniformly adopted throughout the country. Consequently, states vary with respect to the applicable theories of accomplice liability, especially in relation to the relevant mens rea standard.<a id="p-s-457"   class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover"   data-content="See Candace Courteau, “The Mental Element Required for Accomplice Liability: A Topic Note”, Louisiana Law Review, vol. 59 (Fall 1998), pp. 333-334, and references therein. The United States Model Penal Code defines an accomplice as a person who, “with the purpose of promoting or facilitating the commission of the offense”: (i) solicits another person to commit an offence; (ii) aids, agrees or attempts to aid another person in planning or committing it; or (iii) having a legal duty to prevent it, fails to make proper effort so to do” (U.S. Model Penal Code, §2.06(3)). While accomplice liability may be established through any act of facilitating a crime, the Model Penal Code “requires that the actor  …  have as his conscious objective the bringing about of conduct  …   which is  criminal” (U.S. Model Penal Code and Commentaries, pp. 310, 314, 318, fn. 58). With respect to U.S. federal law and practice, for aiding and abetting liability, generally the government must prove that the accused: (i) had the specific intent to facilitate the commission of a crime by another; (ii) had the requisite intent of the underlying substantive offence; and (iii) assisted or participated in the commission of the underlying substantive offence (see, e.g., United States v. Delgado, 357 F.3d 1061, 1065-1066 (9th Cir. 2004); United States v. Lucas, 67 F.3d 956, 959 (D.C. Cir. 1995); United States v. Gaskins, 849 F.2d 454, 457, 459 (9th Cir. 1988); see also 18 U.S.C. §2(a)). Regarding the actus reus, it must be established that the accused assisted or participated in some way to the commission of the underlying offence (see, e.g., United States v. Landerman, 109 F.3d 1053, 1068 n.22 (5th Cir. 1997); United States v. Leos-Quijada, 107 F.3d 786, 794 (10th Cir. 1997); United States v. McKneely, 69 F.3d 1067, 1072 (10th Cir.1995)). With respect to the mens rea, the “purposive attitude” standard (i.e., the accomplice must have the intent that the underlying offence be committed) is the prevailing approach of U.S. federal courts (see, e.g., Nye &amp; Nissen v. United States, 336 U.S. 613, 619 (1949) (“In order to aid and abet another to commit a crime it is necessary that a defendant in ‘some sort associate himself with the venture, that he participate in it as in something that he wishes to bring about, that he seek by his action to make it succeed.’”); United States v. Woods, 148 F.3d 843, 847, 849-850 (7th Cir. 1998); United States v. Bancalari, 110 F.3d 1425, 1429 (9th Cir. 1997); United States v. Lucas, 67 F.3d 956 (D.C. Cir. 1995); United States v. Williamson, 53 F.3d 1500, 1515 (10th Cir. 1995); United States v. Roach, 28 F.3d 729, 736-737 (8th Cir. 1991); United States v. Peoni, 100 F.2d 401, 402 (2nd Cir. 1938)). For claims brought under the U.S. Alien Tort Statute, it has been held that aiding and abetting liability attaches only where an accused carries out “acts specifically directed to assist, encourage, or lend moral support to the perpetration of a certain specific crime, which have a substantial effect on the perpetration of the crime” and acts “with a purpose” to promote or facilitate the commission of the crime (see, e.g., Aziz v. Alcolac, Inc., 658 F.3d 388, 398 (4th Cir. 2011); Kiobel v. Royal Dutch Petroleum Co., 621 F.3d 111, 154, 158 (2nd Cir. 2010); Presbyterian Church of Sudan v. Talisman Energy, 582 F.3d 244, 253, 259 (2nd Cir. 2009))."><sup>5419</sup></a> In Iran, the Islamic Penal Code requires that the accessory commit a positive act by which he knowingly and intentionally facilitates the commission of the crime.<a id="p-s-458"   class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover"   data-content="Kevin Jon Heller and Markus D.

<h5> <u> (ii) Analysis </u> </h5>
<p id="p-s-525"> 1661.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Appeals Chamber first turns to Lazarević’s arguments that he planned the activities of his subordinate units pursuant to directives and orders of the 3rd Army and that he was duty-bound to approve the joint actions of the VJ and the MUP while re-subordination orders were in effect. The Appeals Chamber recalls that the fact that an accused acted pursuant to superior orders does not relieve him of criminal <a id="p-s-526"   class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover"   data-content="Article 7(4) of the Statute. However, acting under superior orders might be considered in mitigation of sentence if the interests of justice so require (see ibid.)."><sup>5461</sup></a> and that, even where a lawful order exists to conduct an operation, an accused may still incur criminal responsibility for crimes committed in the course of that operation.<a id="p-s-527"   class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover"   data-content="Boškoski and Tarčulovski Appeal Judgement, para. 51."><sup>5462</sup></a> The fact that a higher level of military command directed Lazarević to plan the operations of the Priština Corps does not in itself preclude his responsibility for aiding and abetting the crimes of deportation and forcible transfer committed in the course of such operations. Accordingly, his argument that he was following orders and that his actions were thus not voluntary is inapposite and he has failed to show any error on the part of the Trial Chamber. </p>
<p id="p-s-528"> 1662.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lazarević’s contention that his orders were issued in defence of the country against NATO and the KLA is likewise misguided. Whether the resort to the use of force is legitimate under international law is a question of jus ad bellum, which is distinct from whether the way in which that force was used was legal under international humanitarian law,<a id="p-s-529"   class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover"   data-content="Boškoski and Tarčulovski Appeal Judgement, para. 31. See also Kordić and Čerkez Appeal Judgement, para. 812."><sup>5463</sup></a> i.e. jus in bello. The rules of international humanitarian law do not require a military commander to refrain from defending his country but demand that he ensure that his conduct and that of his subordinates comply with established humanitarian principles. In any event, the Trial Chamber found that, while the VJ and the MUP launched their joint offensive against the KLA and NATO, they also launched a widespread and systematic campaign of forcible displacement against the civilian population.<a id="p-s-530"   class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover"   data-content="Trial Judgement, vol. 3, para. 822.

However, the Appeals Chamber observes that the Trial Chamber carefully assessed the challenges to Đorović’s credibility raised by the Defence at trial and found that he was a credible witness with an “independent mind and forthright manner” (Trial Judgement, vol. 1, paras 497-500, 554, 558). Lazarević’s unsubstantiated assertion in relation  to  Đorović’s  credibility  has  failed  to  show  any  error  in  this  assessment  (see  Lazarević’s  Appeal  Brief, para. 553) and his argument in this regard is therefore dismissed. The Appeals Chamber also recalls that it has also dismissed challenges to the Trial Chamber’s reliance on the evidence of Đorović  brought by Pavković (see supra, fn. 4066)."><sup>5515</sup></a>  The Trial Chamber further noted that Ðorović explained that “in a large number of cases during the conflict prosecutors were prevented from criminally prosecuting perpetrators of serious crimes” and that “in practice, the military security organs decided who would and who would not be prosecuted in cases of the most serious crimes, rather than the military prosecutors themselves.”<a id="p-s-600"   class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover"   data-content="Trial Judgement, vol. 1, para. 538, referring to Lakić Ðorović, Exh.

In this context, the Appeals Chamber also notes that while under normal conditions the Priština Corps security department reported on a daily basis to the Priština Corps Commander as well as to the 3rd Army security  department  “when  the  NATO  air  campaign  began,  Stojanović  ₣Chief   of  the  Priština  Corps  security department , on orders from the Security Administration, became duty-bound to report only to the 3rd Army Command” (Trial Judgement, vol. 1, para. 605, and references therein)."><sup>5521</sup></a>  Taking into account these circumstances, the Appeals Chamber considers that it is unclear what degree of effect, if any, additional investigative and punitive measures undertaken by Lazarević at the corps level would have had on the commission of the crimes of forcible transfer and deportation by members of the VJ. </p>
<p id="p-s-607"> 1682.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Appeals Chamber thus considers that irrespective of any failure on his part to take more adequate measures to report, investigate, and initiate disciplinary measures, no reasonable trier of fact could have found beyond reasonable doubt that his omission in this respect had a substantial effect on the commission of the forcible displacement, i.e. that it would have been substantially less likely had Lazarević taken such further measures. Accordingly, the Appeals Chamber finds that the Trial Chamber erred in finding that Lazarević aided and abetted by omission the commission of forcible  displacement  through  “his  failure  to  take  adequate  measures  to  secure  the  proper investigation of serious crimes committed by the VJ”.<a id="p-s-608"   class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover"   data-content="See Trial Judgement, vol. 3, para. 925."><sup>5522</sup></a> In light of this conclusion, it is therefore unnecessary to  address  Lazarević’s remaining  arguments concerning this  finding  of  the  Trial Chamber.<a id="p-s-609"   class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover"   data-content="See Lazarević’s Appeal Brief, paras 554, 563, 565-566, 571, 587."><sup>5523</sup></a> </p>

In particular, Lazarević asserts that the Trial Chamber erred in its assessment of evidence when it found the VJ and the MUP used excessive and indiscriminate force in villages in western Kosovo, Mališevo/Malisheva, and Drenica in 1998 (Lazarević’s Appeal Brief, paras 404-412, 414, 419-422; Lazarević’s Reply Brief, para. 122; contra Prosecution’s Response Brief (Lazarević), paras 254-255.

While the Trial Chamber noted that Lazarević closely followed the events on the ground at the time these incidents occurred, the Appeals Chamber observes that the Trial Chamber’s reliance on this was limited when concluding that he knew of the commission of crimes in 1998 (Trial Judgement, vol. 3, para. 817). The Trial Chamber’s conclusion on Lazarević’s knowledge in 1998 was sufficiently supported by other evidence (see supra,  paras 1698, 1703-1708). His arguments in this respect are therefore dismissed without further discussion."><sup>5598</sup></a> Lazarević’s submission that he believed the population had “temporarily  taken  refuge from the combat operations” merely presents a different interpretation of the evidence without showing any error on the part of the Trial Chamber.<a id="p-s-717"   class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover"   data-content="The Appeals Chamber notes that Lazarević also refers to the testimony of Sandra Mitchell that there was no refugee problem prior to 22 March 1999 (Lazarević’s Appeal Brief, para. 429, referring to Sandra Mitchell, 11 Jul 2006, T. 588). However, Lazarević in this respect mischaracterises her evidence as, although she indicated that there were no “refugees” in 1998, she also stated that there was nevertheless displacement of civilians at that time (Sandra Mitchell, 11 Jul 2006, T. 588).

The Appeals Chamber therefore considers that, at most, the information Lazarević received in 1998 made him aware of the probability that the VJ forces would use excessive and indiscriminate force or commit other crimes if ordered to operate in Kosovo in 1999. However, the Appeals Chamber finds that on the basis of such knowledge alone no reasonable trier of fact could have concluded that the only reasonable inference was that Lazarević knew of the probability that if ordered to operate in Kosovo in 1999, the VJ forces would act with the intent to commit deportation and forcible transfer. </p>

The Appeals Chamber considers the correct references to be to fns 2176-

“pure speculation” and violates the principle in dubio pro reo (Lazarević’s Appeal Brief, para. 536)."><sup>5668</sup></a>   In  response,  the  Prosecution  contends  that  the  Trial  Chamber’s  conclusion  was correct, given the general subject-matter of the press statement and that such information would have been reported to Lazarević.

<p id="p-s-814">1735. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In concluding that Lazarević was made aware of Drewenkiewicz’s press statement, the Trial

Chamber reasoned that:

As described in Section VI.A, the Priština Corps had an intelligence department, responsible for reporting such information to the Commander. Furthermore, the press release specifically referred to the systematic looting and forcible removal of Kosovo Albanians from Priština/Prishtina, where Lazarević was located during the conflict. Given the subject matter of Drewienkiewicz’s press release and his notoriety to the FRY and Serbian authorities, the Chamber is satisfied that Lazarević was made aware of this report at the start of April 1999.<a id="p-s-816"   class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover"   data-content="Trial Judgement, vol. 3, para. 855 (internal references omitted)."><sup>5670</sup></a> </small> </p> </div> <div class="col-md-1"></div> </div>

Absent such evidence, the Appeals Chamber considers that the subject matter of the press statement and Drewienkiewicz’s notoriety were insufficient for a reasonable trier of fact to conclude that the only reasonable inference from the evidence was that Lazarević was made aware of Drewienkiewicz’s press statement. Nor is the Appeals Chamber persuaded by the Prosecution’s submission that due to his presence in Priština/Prishtina Lazarević would have been aware of the press statement. Accordingly, the Appeals Chamber finds that the Trial Chamber erred in relying on Drewienkiewicz’s press statement to infer that Lazarević knew of the commission of crimes by the VJ forces.</p>

displacement of the civilian population and that this was due in part to fear of the VJ and MUP.<a id="p-s-854"   class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover"   data-content="See, e.g., Trial Judgement, vol. 3, paras 838, 849, 924, and references therein."><sup>5696</sup></a>
In these circumstances, the Appeals Chamber considers that Lazarević has failed to show that the Trial Chamber erred in considering his orders for the prevention of crimes and mistreatment of Kosovo Albanian civilians as further evidence supporting the conclusion that he was aware of the
forcible displacement committed by the VJ and the MUP.</p>

<h4><u>(c)   Lazarević’s orders for the protection of civilians</u></h4>


<p id="p-s-895">1756.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  The Trial Chamber considered a number of orders issued by Lazarević pertaining to the relocation, protection, and return of civilians. It noted that “although these measures show that

<h4><u>d)   Whether Lazarević knew that his conduct assisted forcible displacement</u></h4>


<p id="p-s-916">1761. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lazarević argues that he attended only a small number of Joint Command meetings and always insisted that the international community be informed about the situation on the ground in Kosovo and that of the civilian population.<a id="p-s-917"   class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover"   data-content="Lazarević’s Appeal Brief, para. 603."><sup>5744</sup></a> Consequently, Lazarević maintains that he was not aware that his acts or omissions were assisting in the commission of crimes by the members of the

<p id="p-s-920">1762.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Appeals Chamber finds Lazarević’s argument unpersuasive. Lazarević’s submissions in this respect fail to address the large evidentiary basis considered by the Trial Chamber and its reasoning in finding that he was aware that the VJ forcibly displaced Kosovo Albanian civilians during operations against the KLA and that consequently he was aware that his conduct enabling the   forces   to   engage   in   such   operations   thereby   assisted   the   commission   of   forcible

<p id="p-s-926">1765. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the foregoing reasons, the Appeals Chamber concludes that Lazarević has failed to demonstrate that the Trial Chamber erred in finding him responsible for aiding and abetting, pursuant to Article 7(1) of the Statute, the crimes of deportation and inhumane acts (forcible transfer) (under Counts 1 and 2 of the Indictment). Accordingly, the Appeals Chamber upholds his convictions in this regard, except for his convictions for the crimes committed in Kačanik/Kaçanik town, Turićevac/Turiçec village, and Tušilje/Tushila. The Appeals Chamber recalls in this respect that it has found that the Trial Chamber erred in concluding that the VJ forcibly displaced Kosovo

<p id="p-s-986">1781.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In finding that the mental element of aiding and abetting murder had not been established in relation to Lazarević, the Trial Chamber held that:

While the forcible displacements were part of the VJ and MUP organised campaign, the Chamber is not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that killings  …  were intended aims of this campaign. Accordingly, although he was aware of VJ members killing Kosovo Albanians in some instances, it has not been proved that Lazarević was aware that VJ and MUP forces were going into the specific crime sites referred to above in order to commit killings  … .<a id="p-s-987"   class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover"   data-content="Trial Judgement, vol. 3, para. 928."><sup>5789</sup></a></p>

<p id="p-s-990">1783. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  The Appeals Chamber notes that the Prosecution does not challenge any underlying factual findings relevant to Lazarević’s mens rea, namely the various findings on his knowledge of the commission of crimes by the VJ and the MUP prior to and during spring 1999 when the charged crimes were found to have been committed. Rather, the Prosecution avers that the Trial Chamber made all the factual findings necessary to convict Lazarević and that the only reasonable conclusion based  on  those  findings  is  that  he  possessed  the  requisite  mens rea  of  aiding  and  abetting
murder.<a id="p-s-991"   class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover"   data-content="Prosecution’s Appeal Brief, paras 35, 55, 58."><sup>5791</sup></a></p>

<p id="p-s-995">1785. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The  Appeals  Chamber  turns  to  examine  the  Prosecution’s  argument  that  the  Trial Chamber’s factual findings in relation to Lazarević’s knowledge of some instances of killings, could lead a  reasonable trier of fact to  conclude that the only reasonable inference was that
Lazarević had the mens rea for aiding and abetting the murders committed at Korenica/Korenicë and  Meja/Mejë  on  27 April 1999,  and  of  two  Kosovo  Albanians  in  Dubrava/Lisnaja  around 25 May 1999. The Appeals Chamber will first assess whether no reasonable trier of fact could have found that Lazarević did not have the mens rea for aiding and abetting the murders committed in Korenica/Korenicë  and  Meja/Mejë  on  27 April 1999,  by  addressing  the  relevant  evidence  and factual findings cited by the Prosecution related to his knowledge up to the time of these murders. Subsequently, the Appeals Chamber will consider whether no reasonable trier of fact could have concluded that Lazarević did not have the mens rea for aiding and abetting the murders committed in Dubrava/Lisnaja around 25 May 1999, in light of the totality of the evidence on his knowledge by this date.</p>

<p id="p-s-1024">1793. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Appeals Chamber also finds that the Prosecution has failed to demonstrate that Lazarević’s 24 May 1999 report indicating his knowledge of instances of murder committed by MUP members at checkpoints, even when viewed in combination with the other evidence before the Trial Chamber, would lead a reasonable trier of fact to conclude that the only reasonable inference is that by 25 May 1999, Lazarević knew that the MUP and VJ forces would act with the intent to murder Kosovo Albanian civilians during their operation in Dubrava/Lisnaja.

<p id="p-s-1027">1794. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Furthermore, the Prosecution suggests that Lazarević’s awareness of the excessive use of force in 1998 and the campaign of terror, violence, and forcible displacement carried out by joint VJ and MUP forces against Kosovo Albanians in 1999, when viewed with the evidence of Lazarević’s  knowledge  of  some  incidents  of  killings,  confirms  the  conclusion  that  he  knew “murders were likely” during joint VJ and MUP operations in Kosovo in 1999.<a id="p-s-1028"   class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover"   data-content=" Prosecution’s  Appeal  Brief,  para.  49,  referring  to  Trial  Judgement,  vol.  3,  paras  923-924,  928.

conclusion that he also knew of an intent of the VJ and MUP forces to commit murder.<a id="p-s-1029"   class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover"   data-content="See Prosecution’s Appeal Brief, paras 49-51, 55-56."><sup>5818</sup></a>

to commit murder during their operations in Korenica/Korenicë and Meja/Mejë on 27 April 1999 and in Dubrava/Lisnaja around 25 May 1999.</p>

<p id="p-s-1031">1795. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In view of the above considerations, the Appeals Chamber finds that the Prosecution has failed to show an error in the Trial Chamber’s conclusion that Lazarević did not have the requisite mens  rea   for  aiding  and  abetting  the  murders  in  Korenica/Korenicë  and  Meja/Mejë  on
27 April 1999, and in Dubrava/Lisnaja around 25 May 1999. In light of the foregoing, the Appeals

As to  the  existence  of  “new  mitigating  circumstances”,  the  Prosecution  contends  that  the  proper method to raise subsequent developments that mitigate a sentence is to file a motion under Rule 115 of the Rules.</p>

<p id="p-s-1068">1821. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Appeals Chamber observes that the Trial Chamber discussed the factors raised by Lazarević at length. The Trial Chamber treated his surrender, his health and family circumstances, and his interview with the Prosecution as mitigating circumstances. However, it gave limited weight to Lazarević’s purported good character and considered that his decision to take the stand in his own defence did not have a mitigating effect. Lazarević merely contests the Trial Chamber’s evaluation of these factors and has failed to show any discernible error in this respect. Moreover, he has failed to substantiate the existence of “new” mitigating circumstances to which he alludes in his Appeal Brief. In these circumstances, the Appeals Chamber dismisses this
sub-ground of his appeal.</p>

In  addition,  the Prosecution asserts that the gravity of the crimes aided and abetted by Lazarević are comparable to those for which Radoslav Brđanin was convicted and sentenced to 30 years of imprisonment. Likewise, the Prosecution contends that Milan Martić was sentenced to 35 years of imprisonment as a JCE member held responsible for the commission crimes similar  to  those  committed  by  Šainović,  Pavković,  and  Lukić.

The Appeals Chamber recalls that sentencing decisions in other cases can provide guidance if they relate to substantially similar circumstances, but this guidance is limited by Article 24(2) of the Statute, which requires the Trial Chamber to assess the individual circumstances of the convicted person and the gravity of the offence. See Stakić Appeal  Judgement,  para.  381.  The  Trial  Chamber  clearly  noted  the  interplay  of  these  standards,  observing  that “previous sentencing practice is but one factor among a host of others that must be taken into account when determining the sentence” and that “the Chamber has applied its judgement and discretion to the facts that have been proved in this case, including the context and background circumstances amidst which the crimes were committed.” See Trial Judgement, vol. 3, para. 1143.

<br>




<p id="p-s-1204">1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this Appeal Judgement, the Appeals Chamber, by majority, affirms Šainović’s convictions pursuant to Article 7(1) of the Statute for committing, based on JCE I, the crimes of deportation and other inhumane acts (forcible transfer) as crimes against humanity.

 The Majority further upholds Šainović’s convictions pursuant to JCE III for murder and persecutions through murder as crimes against humanity as well as murder as a violation of the laws or customs of war in relation to a single incident at Dubrava/Lisnaja,

<p id="p-s-1209">2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the reasons set out below, I respectfully disagree with the Majority that the Trial Chamber reasonably found that Šainović made a significant contribution to the common purpose and thus participated in the JCE.

<p id="p-s-1210">3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With  respect  to  Lazarević,  the  Appeals  Chamber  affirms  his  convictions  pursuant  to Article 7(1) of the Statute for aiding and abetting the crimes of deportation and other inhumane acts (forcible transfer) as crimes against humanity.

<br>


<p id="p-s-1215">40.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the context of Lazarević’s appeal against his convictions for aiding and abetting, the Majority discusses in great detail the issue of specific direction.
<!-- Begin Footnote 90 --> <a id="p-s-1216"   class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover"   data-content="90.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See Appeal Judgement, paras 1617-1651.
"> <sup>90</sup> </a> <!-- End Footnote -->

  I have no intention to comment on whether or not specific direction is an element of aiding and abetting. Rather, for the reasons set out below, I am not convinced that this Appeal Judgement is the appropriate forum to address the issue, especially because it has no pertinence to Lazarević’s case. Accordingly, I also refrain from joining any finding of the Majority which in my understanding may constitute a new statement in substance on the issue of specific direction.
</p>

<p id="p-s-1217">41.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In  paving  the  ground  for  its  assessment,  the  Majority  considers  that  the  interpretation favored by Lazarević on the basis of the Tadić Appeal Judgment and others that specific direction is an element of the actus reus of aiding and abetting and must be established beyond reasonable doubt91 “would appear
<!-- Begin Footnote 91 --> <a id="p-s-1218"   class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover"   data-content="91.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See  Lazarević’s Appeal Brief para 342.

 to be at odds  …  with a plain reading” of the Mrkšić and Šlivančanin Appeal Judgement and the ruling in the Lukić and Lukić Appeal Judgement.
<!-- Begin Footnote 92 --> <a id="p-s-1219"   class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover"   data-content="92.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Appeal Judgement, para. 1621.
"> <sup>92</sup> </a>  <!-- End Footnote -->

</p><!-- End 41 -->


<p id="p-s-1220">42.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Majority then proceeds by stating that, where faced with conflicting previous decisions, the Appeals Chamber is obliged to determine which decision to follow or whether to depart from both decisions for cogent reasons in the interests of justice.
<!-- Footnote 93 -->
<a id="p-s-1221"   class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover"   data-content="93.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Appeal Judgement, para. 1622.
"> <sup>93</sup> </a> <!-- End Footnote -->

 In an accompanying footnote, the Majority considers that the issue was raised by the parties but the Trial Chamber made no finding on this matter.
<!-- Footnote 94 --> <a id="p-s-1222"   class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover"   data-content="94.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Appeal Judgement, fn. 5320.
"> <sup>94</sup> </a>

 Consequently, the Majority concludes that the discussion as to whether specific direction is required “cannot be circumvented in determining the outcome of the present case”.
<!-- Footnote 95 --> <a id="p-s-1223"   class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover"   data-content="95.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Appeal Judgement, fn. 5320.
"> <sup>95</sup> </a>

 In addition, the Majority notes that even if requiring “specific direction” would not ultimately invalidate the Trial Judgement, the Appeals Chamber may hear appeals in which a party has raised a legal issue of general significance to the Tribunal’s jurisprudence, and concludes that the significance of the issue at hand warrants the intervention by the Appeals Chamber.
<!-- Footnote 96 --> <a id="p-s-1224"   class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover"   data-content="96.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Appeal Judgement, fn. 5320.
"> <sup>96</sup> </a>

</p> <!-- End 42 -->


<p id="p-s-1225">43.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While these explanations purport to demonstrate that it is absolutely necessary to address the issue of specific direction in this Appeal Judgement, I remain unconvinced. Specifically, I observe in bewilderment the Majority’s reasoning that if it were to adopt the requirement of “specific direction,” it would have to examine whether Lazarević’s assistance was indeed specifically directed at the underlying crimes. However, the Majority explicitly considers specific direction at length anyway. At the very least, the Majority could have restricted its holding to cases such as the present one where the accused is physically present at the act of the crime, even if perhaps not at the very moment the crime is commited, while leaving for another day the question if “specific direction” may be required if the accused is remote from the site of the crime.
<!-- Footnote 97 --><a id="p-s-1226"   class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover"   data-content="97.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my view, the Majority’s reasoning potentially applies to all cases where the aider and abettor is not physically present when the crime is committed.
"> <sup>97</sup> </a> 
<!-- Footnote 98 --> <a id="p-s-1227"   class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover"   data-content="98.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard, I note the holding of the Appeals Chamber in the Aleksovski  case: “What is followed in previous decisions is the legal principle (ratio decidendi), and the obligation to follow that principle only applies in similar cases, or substantially similar cases. This means less that the facts are similar or substantially similar, than that the question raised by the facts in the subsequent case is the same as the question decided by the legal principle in the previous decision. There is no obligation to follow previous decisions which may be distinguished for one reason or another from the case before the court.” See Aleksovski Appeal Judgement, para. 110.
"> <sup>98</sup> </a> 

</p> <!-- End 43 -->


 
<p id="p-s-1228">44.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, even if it were unavoidable to discuss the issue of “specific direction” here, I cannot discern how the Majority arrives at the conclusion that this matter “cannot be circumvented in determining the outcome of the present case”.
<!-- Footnote 99 --> <a id="p-s-1229"   class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover"   data-content="99.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Appeal Judgement, fn. 5320.
"> <sup>99</sup> </a>

 Any impact of the “specific direction” requirement on Lazarević’s case would require showing that his assistance was indeed not “specifically directed” at the commission of crimes.
<!-- Footnote 100 --> <a id="p-s-1230"   class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover"   data-content="100.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard, I note with interest that the Majority never defines the meaning of “specific direction.”
"> <sup>100</sup> </a>

 However, the Majority makes no finding in this regard. Accordingly, it is not clear to me whether the Majority’s rejection of specific direction as an element of aiding and abetting was dispositive of its decision to affirm Lazarević’s convictions for aiding and abetting or is made obiter dicta.
</p> <!-- End 44 -->


<p id="p-s-1231">45.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While it is within the Appeals Chamber’s discretion to consider legal matters of general importance to the Tribunal’s case law,
<!-- Footnote 101 --> <a id="p-s-1232"   class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover"   data-content="101.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See, e.g., Kanyarukiga Appeal Judgement, para. 267.
"> <sup>101</sup> </a>

  I think that this exceptional measure should not be resorted to here.

</p> <!-- End 45 -->

 
<p id="p-s-1233">46.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For these reasons, I tend to think that the issue of specific direction would have better been left for discussion in cases where this matter is clearly relevant to the conviction of an accused and the parties have reason and opportunity to focus their full attention on it.

</p> <!-- End 46 -->


<p id="p-s-1234">47.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, I recall that in order to ensure the fair trial rights of an accused to have “like cases treated alike”, the Appeals Chamber should follow its previous decisions unless there are cogent reasons to depart from them in the interests of justice.
<!-- Footnote 102 --> <a id="p-s-1235"   class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover"   data-content="102 Aleksovski Appeal Judgement, paras 107, 113.
"> <sup>102</sup> </a>

  Irrespective of whether there is a divergence between the Mrkšić and Šlivančanin and Lukić and Lukić Appeal Judgements on the one hand and the Tadić  line of cases on the other, it is quite clear that the Majority in this Appeal Judgement departs from the latter. The Majority mentions the cogent reasons standard in passing,
<!-- Footnote 103 -->  <a id="p-s-1236"   class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover"   data-content="103 Appeal Judgement, para. 1622.
"> <sup>103</sup> </a> 

  but provides no explanation as to whether it was guided by that standard in reaching its conclusions.
<!-- Footnote 104 --> <a id="p-s-1237"   class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover"   data-content="104 For details, see Aleksovski Appeal Judgement, paras 107-109.
"> <sup>104</sup> </a>

</p> <!-- End 47 -->


<p id="p-s-1238">48.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I note that in its assessment of other international jurisprudence and domestic law on aiding and abetting, the Majority resorts to a discussion of post-WWII cases, some of which do not necessarily concern this mode of liability,
<!-- Footnote 105 --> <a id="p-s-1239"   class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover"   data-content="105 See Appeal Judgement, fn. 5340.
"> <sup>105</sup> </a>

 as well as general rules governing the mens rea.
<!-- Footnote 106 --> <a id="p-s-1240"   class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover"   data-content="106 See Appeal Judgement, paras 1627-1648.
"> <sup>106</sup> </a>

  The Majority concludes on the basis of its analysis that specific direction “is not an element of aiding and abetting liability under customary international law”,
<!-- Footnote 107 --> <a id="p-s-1241"   class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover"   data-content="107 Appeal Judgement, para. 1649.
"> <sup>107</sup> </a>

  while subsequently confirming the ruling in the Mrkšić and Šlivančanin and Lukić and Lukić Appeal Judgements that specific direction is not an essential ingredient of the actus reus of aiding and abetting.
<!-- Footnote 108 --> <a id="p-s-1242"   class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover"   data-content="108 Appeal Judgement, para. 1650.
"> <sup>108</sup> </a>

  In light of these findings, it is not clear to me whether the Majority considers its assessment and conclusions to be limited to the actus reus of aiding and abetting and thus indeed merely a reaffirmation of the statements in the Mrkšić and Šlivančanin and Lukić and Lukić Appeal Judgements. Arguably, to conclude that specific direction is not an “essential ingredient of the actus reus of aiding and abetting”
