 humanity, pursuant to Articles 3 and 5 of the Statute of the Tribunal ("Statute"), respectively.
 </p>
 <p id="tc-s-54">
 6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pursuant to Article 7(1) of the Statute, Vuković is alleged to bear individual criminal responsibility for having aided and abetted in the

 <p id="tc-s-60">
 8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prosecution further alleges that Vuković created an environment of impunity in which his subordinates believed they could commit crimes

 9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prosecution alleges that an extensive campaign of shelling and sniping took place in Sarajevo between August 1993 and November 1995, where
 civilians were specifically targeted or were subjected to reckless fire in areas where civilians were known to have been.<a id="tc-s-64" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Indictment, paras 40, 42; Annexes A and B to the Indictment."><sup>14</sup></a> The Prosecution contends

 instructing the VRS to eliminate the Muslim enclaves of Vlasenica and Žepa in furtherance of the "six strategic objectives" of
 12 May 1992. The Prosecution contends that between 6 and 11 July 1995, the Vlasenica enclave came under attack from the VRS and other Bosnian Serb
 forces under the command and control of Ratko Mladić. It is alleged that Vuković was aware of the planned attack, of the "six strategic
 objectives", and of the fact that some members of the VRS would engage in criminal conduct against the Bosnian Muslim civilian population; criminal
 conduct that would include persecution,
 forcible transfers and killings.<a id="tc-s-90" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Indictment, para. 56; Prosecution Final Brief, paras 388-404, 636."><sup>28</sup></a>

 forces under the command and control of Mladić and were summarily executed between 13 and 19 July 1995 and buried in mass graves. The Prosecution
 contends that between 1 August 1995 and 1 November 1995, VRS units under the command of Mladić participated in an organised effort to conceal the
 killings by
 reburying bodies of Bosnian Muslim men killed in July 1995, exhumed from mass graves.<a id="tc-s-92" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Indictment, para. 57; Prosecution Final Brief, paras 416-436."><sup>29</sup></a>

 BiH.<a id="tc-s-94" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Indictment, para. 57."><sup>30</sup></a>

 The Prosecution contends that Vuković aided and abetted these crimes with the knowledge that the assistance he provided would be used in the

 <u>C. Considerations Regarding the Evidence</u>
 </h2>
 <h3 id="tc-s-105" class="text-center">
 <u>1. General Evidentiary Principles</u>
 </h3>
 <p id="tc-s-106">
 22.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Trial Chamber has received evidence both in oral and documentary form. This evidence was diverse in nature, ranging from direct evidence,
 circumstantial evidence, original and hearsay evidence, to facts agreed upon by the Parties or previously adjudicated before this Tribunal. The
 evidence also included written statements in lieu of oral testimony admitted pursuant to Rules 92 bis, 92 ter and 92 quater of the Rules of Procedure
 and Evidence of the Tribunal ("Rules").
 </p>
 <p id="tc-s-107">
 23.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Trial Chamber has duly considered and given appropriate weight to all the evidence adduced at trial in light of the entire trial record, in
 accordance with the Statute and the Rules even if not expressly referred to. The Trial Chamber underlines that the right of an accused to a reasoned opinion in writing, as set forth in Article 23(2) of the Statute and Rule 98 ter(C), in no way imposes an obligation to explain every detail of its
 assessment of the evidence adduced during the trial.<a id="tc-s-110" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="See Kvočka et al. Appeal Judgement, para. 23."><sup>36</sup></a>
 </p>
 <p id="tc-s-111">
 24.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Article 21(3) of the Statute establishes that an accused shall be presumed innocent until proven guilty.<a id="tc-s-112" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Article 21(3) of the Statute."><sup>37</sup></a> The Prosecution bears the burden of
 proof for the guilt of the Accused and must establish beyond reasonable doubt each element of the crimes and of the modes of liability charged as well
 as any fact indispensable for conviction.<a id="tc-s-113" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Rule 87(A) of the Rules; Limaj et al. Trial Judgement, para. 10; Brđanin Trial Judgement, para. 22. The fact that the Defence has not challenged certain factual allegations contained in the Indictment does not mean that the Trial Chamber has accepted these facts to be proven."><sup>38</sup></a> Hence, in accordance with the principle in dubio pro reo, the Trial Chamber resolved any reasonable doubt
 as to the guilt of the Accused in his favour.
 </p>
 <p id="tc-s-114">
 25.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the start of the trial, the Trial Chamber issued "Guidelines" that governed the presentation and admission of evidence during the trial.<a id="tc-s-115" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Order for Guidelines on the Admission and Presentation of Evidence and Conduct of Counsel in Court, 29 October 2008 (“Guidelines&quot;)."><sup>39</sup></a>
 </p>
 <p id="tc-s-116">
 26.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In its evaluation of viva voce witnesses, the Trial Chamber took into consideration the demeanour of a witness on the stand, as well as individual
 circumstances, including any protective measures granted. In assessing the viva voce witnesses, the Trial Chamber also considered the time that elapsed
 since the crimes alleged in the Indictment occurred and its possible impact on the accuracy of the testimony. Hence, the lack of precision, or the
 existence of minor discrepancies between a previous statement or testimony and the one given in this case, did not necessarily discredit the testimony.
 </p>
 <p id="tc-s-117">
 27.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearsay evidence is evidence of facts not within the witness's own knowledge.<a id="tc-s-118" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Halilović Trial Judgement, para. 15."><sup>40</sup></a> The jurisprudence of the Tribunal allows admission of hearsay
 evidence pursuant to Rule 89(C). The weight to be attributed to that evidence depends on the circumstances.<a id="tc-s-119" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="See Aleksovski February 1999 Appeal Decision, para. 15."><sup>41</sup></a> In particular, the Trial Chamber has
 taken into account the fact that the original source was not the subject of a solemn declaration or tested by cross-examination and that the
 reliability of such evidence could be flawed by a potential compounding of errors of perception and memory.
 </p>
 <p id="tc-s-120">
 28.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Circumstantial evidence is evidence of circumstances surrounding an event from which a fact at issue may be reasonably inferred.<a id="tc-s-121" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="See Čelebići Appeal Judgement, para. 458."><sup>42</sup></a> Where an
 inference is drawn from circumstantial evidence to establish a fact on which a conviction relies, that inference must be the only reasonable one that could be drawn from the evidence
 presented.<a id="tc-s-124" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Stakić Appeal Judgement, para. 219. See also Čelebići Appeal Judgement, para. 458; Had`ihasanović and Kubura Appeal Judgement, para. 286."><sup>43</sup></a>
 </p>
 <p id="tc-s-125">
 29.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evidence of a single witness on a material fact does not, as a matter of law, require corroboration.<a id="tc-s-126" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Aleksovski Appeal Judgement, para. 62; Čelebići Appeal Judgement, para. 506. See also Tadić Appeal Judgement, para. 65."><sup>44</sup></a> However, the Trial Chamber has carefully
 analysed such evidence before relying upon it to a decisive extent.
 </p>
 <p id="tc-s-127">
 30.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In its Final Brief, the Defence argues that evidence originating from the same source but at different times does not amount to corroboration.<a id="tc-s-128" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Defence Final Brief, para. 32."><sup>45</sup></a>
 Likewise, it posits that a person giving the same narration more than once is not corroboration but mere proof of a good memory.<a id="tc-s-129" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Ibid."><sup>46</sup></a> The Trial Chamber
 recalls that there is no specific legal requirement as to the source of corroboration.<a id="tc-s-130" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="See Haraqija and Morina Appeal Judgement, para. 62."><sup>47</sup></a>
 However, the Trial Chamber is of the view that generally a person cannot corroborate his or her own testimony and has considered evidence originating
 from the same person but at different times to be reflective of the consistency of the witness's testimony and has accorded it appropriate weight.
 </p>
 <p id="tc-s-131">
 31.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In assessing the authenticity of documentary evidence, the Trial Chamber considered various factors such as the source of the evidence, its chain
 of custody and other evidence relating to the document. In accordance with its Guidelines, the Trial Chamber did not consider unsigned or unstamped
 documents to be necessarily void of authenticity.<a id="tc-s-132" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="See Decision on Prosecution's Second and Third Bar Table Motions, 16 November 2009, para. 13; Guidelines, para. 34."><sup>48</sup></a> When the Trial Chamber was satisfied of the authenticity of a particular document, it did not
 automatically accept the statements contained therein to be an accurate portrayal of the facts.<a id="tc-s-133" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="See Guidelines, para. 32."><sup>49</sup></a> Rather, the Trial Chamber evaluated all evidence
 within the context of the entire trial record.
 </p>
 <p id="tc-s-134">
 32.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In evaluating the evidence adduced through witnesses in court, the Trial Chamber assessed whether the witnesses were reliable. In this light, the
 Trial Chamber notes that credibility is an essential element that needs to be satisfied in order for a witness to be found reliable. The Trial Chamber
 took into account any potential bias or partiality on the part of a witness.
 </p>
 <p id="tc-s-135">
 33.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the witnesses may have had close links with persons involved in the commission of crimes during the conflict in the former Yugoslavia and
 thus may have had a personal interest in being inaccurate in their testimony. In other cases, witnesses seemed to feel a sense of loyalty towards the Accused and were evasive in providing
 answers implicating the acts or omissions of Vuković. The Chamber has considered this factor when weighing and assessing their credibility.<a id="tc-s-138" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="See e.g. DragomirVasić and Borivoje Tešić."><sup>50</sup></a>
 </p>
 <p id="tc-s-139">
 34.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where witnesses were found to have displayed a lack of candour towards the Trial Chamber, their evidence was not relied upon. However, in cases
 where only part of the testimony was found to be unreliable, the Trial Chamber did not disregard the entire testimony but only rejected the portion it
 found to be unreliable.

 40.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Trial Chamber is guided by the Appeals Chamber holding in Galić, according to which "where the witness who made the statement is not
 called to give the accused an adequate and proper opportunity to challenge the statement and to question that witness, the evidence which the statement
 contains may lead to a conviction only if there is other evidence which corroborates the
 statement".<a id="tc-s-163" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Galić June 2002 Appeal Rule 92 bis(C) Decision; Blagojević and Jokić Trial Judgement, paras 316-318."><sup>63</sup></a>

 applicable to both parties.<a id="tc-s-231" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Guidelines, p. 2."><sup>105</sup></a> The purpose of this part of the Guidelines was to ensure that a party using a prior statement of a different person to

 based on Milan Lešić's prior interview with the Prosecution.<a id="tc-s-232" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Ned Krayishnik, T. 9639-9644."><sup>106</sup></a> Since the Defence did not call or try to call Lešić to testify
 during the Defence case, the part of Krayishnik's testimony regarding Lešić's prior interview will not be considered by the Trial Chamber.
 Considering that the Defence had the opportunity to call Lešić and was well aware of the Guidelines the Trial Chamber is of the view that the
 Accused was not prejudiced by the application of paragraphs 12 and 13 of the Guidelines. In addition, the Trial Chamber notes that
 neither party sought reconsideration of the Guidelines, nor certification to appeal them, upon their
 adoption at the start of the trial.

 violence between governmental authorities and organised armed groups or between such groups within a State".<a id="tc-s-275" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Ibid."><sup>129</sup></a> Until a general conclusion of peace or
 a peaceful settlement is reached, international humanitarian law continues to apply "in the whole territory of the warring States or, in the case of
 internal conflicts, the whole territory under the control of a party, whether or not actual combat takes place there".<a id="tc-s-276" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Tadić October 1995 Appeal Jurisdiction Decision, para. 70.

 Conventions of 1949. These articles both provide, in relevant part, that " t he civilian population as such, as well as individual civilians, shall not

 contiguous with one another&quot;, Robert Donia, T. 1690, 1711-1712, 1831-1835. The corridor lies along the southern bank of the Sava River, which was the
 northern boundary of Bosnia and was the only land route connecting the eastern part of the SerBiH with the western part of the SerBiH. The corridor
 therefore was important as the land route linking Serbia with many portions of RSK in Croatia, Patrick Treanor, T. 1100-1101, 1108. On

Adjudicated Facts from the Galić and D. Milošević Trial Judgements with regard to the number of 1st ABiH Corps in the city of Sarajevo. The D. Milošević Trial Judgement states that the 1st Corps totalled 75,000 soldiers,
of which 40,000-45,000 were in Sarajevo, and that the number fell to 35,000-40,000 at the end of 1994 (Defence Adjudicated Facts II, 83-84). The Galić Trial Judgement, on the other hand, states that the 75,000 soldiers were all stationed around Sarajevo, with “ a pproximately half of them were positioned in the city itself, while the other half was positioned along the confrontation lines outside the city” (Sarajevo Adjudicated Facts I, 53). Considering the context of the Galić Trial Judgement, particularly the footnote to said adjudicated facts, the Trial
Chamber notes that this number included the part of the 1st Corps positioned on the outer ring of Sarajevo and
that the number of soldiers estimated to be in the city was also between 33,000 and 50,000, which is consistent with the adjudicated facts from the D. Milošević Trial Judgement.

<p id="tc-s-1345"> 327.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Expert witness Van der Weijden explained that conventionally, the traditional military sniper operates in a shooter/spotter team in order to maximise the accuracy of the shot.

Particularly, since the siege of Sarajevo, the term sniper is used to indicate a shooter who fires at
whoever he gets in his sight.<a id="tc-s-1346" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Ex. P493, Report of Patrick van der Weijden: “Milošević case Sniping Incident in Sarajevo 94-95”,

<p id="tc-s-1427"> 343.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Considering that such adjudicated facts have not been rebutted during the trial, the Trial Chamber finds beyond a reasonable doubt that on 4 February l994 at 11:00 hours, three mortar shells struck a residential neighbourhood in Dobrinja killing at least eight people including a child and injuring at least 18 people including two children. </p>
<p id="tc-s-1428"> 344.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Trial Chamber finds that the attack occurred in a civilian area with no military activities in the vicinity.<a id="tc-s-1429" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Sarajevo Adjudicated Facts I, 208-2011, 212-220, 224."><sup>897</sup></a> The Trial Chamber also finds that the only reasonable inference to be drawn from the evidence is that the victims of this attack were civilians not taking part in hostilities at the time the incident occurred.

<p id="tc-s-1430"> 345.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Defence challenges the evidence of MP-228 insofar as it relates to the source of fire. It points out that MP-228’s uncorroborated findings contain just conclusions and do not include any
specific evidence on the angle of descent, range of fire, the charge of the shell or other criteria
necessary to determine the origin of fire.<a id="tc-s-1431" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Defence Final Brief, para. 527."><sup>898</sup></a> The Defence submits that the mere establishing of the direction of fire is not conclusive of the origin of fire as any position along the axis of fire could be a potential source of fire for the shell.<a id="tc-s-1432" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Defence Final Brief, para. 530."><sup>899</sup></a> It further points out in this respect that the evidence of MP-
238, a member of the Bosnian unit charged with the ballistics investigations, suggests that the location of the ABiH forces in the line of fire was not considered as an essential factor in establishing the origin of fire with regard to another shelling incident.<a id="tc-s-1433" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Defence Final Brief, para. 528."><sup>990</sup></a> </p>
<p id="tc-s-1434"> 346.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Defence also specifically challenges the credibility of MP-228. It argues that as an employee of the Bosnian Government, he had “no interest in concluding that anyone other than the SRK was responsible for firing the shells” since “it benefited the Bosnian Government to exploit
the situation to obtain favourable responses from the international community”.<a id="tc-s-1435" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Ibid."><sup>901</sup></a> </p>
<p id="tc-s-1436"> 347.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, according to the Defence, the fact that this incident was omitted in the indictment against Ratko Mladić and Radovan Karad`ić may lead to the “most reasonable” inference that the Prosecution investigators were unable to reach the conclusion that Bosnian Serbs were
responsible.<a id="tc-s-1437" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Defence Final Brief, para. 529."><sup>902</sup></a> </p>
<p id="tc-s-1438"> 348.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chamber notes that MP-228, in concluding that the shells originated in the SRK held territory, does not give any details on how, having established the direction of fire, his team reached the conclusion as to the origin of fire. The Chamber however finds the Defence’s credibility challenge to MP-228 to be speculative and that the fact that certain elements were not taken into
account in another investigation has limited weight in the present considerations.<a id="tc-s-1439" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="See also infra para. 408."><sup>903</sup></a> Consequently,
the Trial Chamber has no reason to doubt the conclusions reached by MP-228. </p>
<p> 349.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Trial Chamber therefore finds beyond a reasonable doubt that the shells fired were the
120mm mortar shells fired from the VRS-held positions at Lukavica. </p>

<h5 id="tc-s-1503"> <u> (v) Findings </u> </h5>
<p> 364.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Trial Chamber finds beyond a reasonable doubt that on 22 December 1994 at about
9:10 hours, two shells exploded in rapid succession at the flea market in Baščaršija, killing two people and injuring seven. The Trial Chamber also finds that the shells were 76mm with UTI M68 fuses and not 82mm, as concluded by the UNPROFOR team. Ekrem Suljević testified that the fuses
UTI M68, fragments which were found on the site, were not used in 82mm mortar shells.<a id="tc-s-1504" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Ekrem Suljević, T. 4751, 4793. The investigators were using a military book published by the Federal Secretariat for National Defence of the former Yugoslavia with a detailed description of the shells and what type of fuses
are used for which type of shell, Ekrem Suljević, T. 4763, 4804."><sup>947</sup></a>
Furthermore, the witness testified that mortar shells, unlike artillery shells, normally have a stabiliser or a fin attached to them to maintain the direction of the projectile. In that incident, however, no stabilisers related to 82mm mortar shells were found on the ground.<a id="tc-s-1505" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Ekrem Suljević, T. 4752-4753.

Facts, 40."><sup>948</sup></a> </p>
<p id="tc-s-1506"> 365.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Trial Chamber also finds that the only reasonable inference to be drawn from the evidence is that all the victims were civilians not taking part in hostilities at the time the incident occurred. The Trial Chamber bases its finding on: (i) the evidence that the flea market was a very densely populated civilian area and there were no military installations or activities around; (ii) the
report of the civilian police stating that the victims were “civilians”; and (iii) the statements of eye-
witnesses and injured referring to the civilian status of the victims and the fact that the victims were engaged, on the day of the incident, in civilian activities and had civilian clothes.<a id="tc-s-1507" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="In this regard, the Trial Chamber notes that one victim, Mirsad Delić, on the day of the incident, wore an uniform which, however, belonged to the civilian police and not to the military, Ex.

<p id="tc-s-1508"> 366.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the question whether the shells originated from VRS-held positions, the evidence shows that both VRS and ABiH forces were present in the area of Mount Trebević. In this regard, Suljević testified that the confrontation line between VRS and ABiH forces was located in the area
of Mount Trebević.<a id="tc-s-1509" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Ekrem Suljević, T. 4747; Ex. P415, Report by CSB Sarajevo on Shelling Incident of 22 December 1994, p. 13

this specific case - but only “believed” that this came from “the region that was controlled by the Army of Republika Srpska”.<a id="tc-s-1510" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Ekrem Suljević, T. 4747-4749. See also Defence Adjudicated Facts, 43, stating that “ t he KDZ investigative team did not calculate the distance from which the shell was fired or the angle of dissent”."><sup>951</sup></a> No evidence was adduced in relation to the charge of the shells, which would have provided an indication as to the distance travelled by the shells.<a class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="See Defence Adjudicated Facts, 47-48, the latter stating that “ the charge [of a mortar shell] determines the speed, and thus, the distance travelled by the shell.

<h5 id="tc-s-1687"> <u> (v) Findings </u> </h5>
<p > 403.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Trial Chamber finds beyond a reasonable doubt that on 18 June 1995 at about 11:40 hours, a 120mm mortar shell exploded at the Simon Bolivar School in Dobrinja, killing 7 and injuring 12 individuals. </p>
<p id="tc-s-1688"> 404.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Trial Chamber also finds that the only reasonable inference that can be drawn from the evidence is that all the victims were civilians not taking part in hostilities at the time. The mortar shell hit the Simon Bolivar School, a civilian building used solely as a water distribution point for the inhabitants of Dobrinja and the victims were all neighbours engaged in a civilian activity, i.e. standing in line for their turn to fetch water. Furthermore, the Trial Chamber notes the testimony of MP-238 and the findings of the CSB report, according to which the victims were civilians. </p>
<p id="tc-s-1689"> 405.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the origin of the fire, the Defence submits that it cannot be reached beyond a reasonable doubt that the VRS fired the shell.<a id="tc-s-1690" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Defence Final Brief, para. 540, citing to the testimony of Hansen and Higgs. See supra paras 398, 402."><sup>1077</sup></a> The Defence also argues that the provenance of the manufacture of the shell from Valjevo, Serbia, cannot support the CSB investigators’ conclusion, as the ABiH recovered and fired VRS 120mm mortar shells.<a id="tc-s-1691" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Defence Final Brief, para. 541 citing to the testimony of MP-238."><sup>1</sup></a>1078 In addition, the Defence argues that it is equally plausible that the ABiH fired the shell “in the midst of the campaign to break-out of Sarajevo”, but that the CSB investigating team had no interest in concluding that anyone other than the SRK was responsible for firing the shells”, rather they reached an “unproved assumption that the SRK was responsible”.<a id="tc-s-1692" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Defence Final Brief, para. 544."><sup>1079</sup></a> </p>
<p id="tc-s-1693"> 406.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Trial Chamber finds that these arguments – individually or collectively – do not raise any reasonable doubt as to the origin of the fire. </p>
<p id="tc-s-1694"> 407.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MP-238 testified that it was impossible for the mortar to have been fired by ABiH as its position was too close to the impact site.<a id="tc-s-1695" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="MP-238, T. 2773."><sup>1080</sup></a> This is supported by the expert opinion of Higgs that Ned`arići was the most likely firing position, but that the shell “could have still come from further away”<a id="tc-s-1696" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Ex. P478, Report on Firing Incident Involving Mortars in the Sarajevo Area Dated 18 June 1995, 21 December 2006, p. 12 (emphasis added)."><sup>1081</sup></a> </p>
<p id="tc-s-1697"> 408.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Defence asserts that MP-238 did not take into account the proximity of the confrontation line during the investigation “as it was not an essential factor”. The Trial Chamber notes that the witness testified that he used a map which shows exactly the confrontation line, so he
was aware of its distance to the impact site. The Trial Chamber is satisfied therefore that MP-238 took into consideration the confrontation line in making his determination as to the origin of fire.<a id="tc-s-1698" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="MP-238, T. 2774, specifically saying that the map was used in a previous case, where he drew the exact location of the confrontation lines."><sup>1082</sup></a> </p>
<p id="tc-s-1699"> 409.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the same token, the Trial Chamber is also not persuaded that the CSB failed to perform a professionally objective investigation. To the contrary, the evidence shows that the methodology used by the Bosnian investigators was correct.<a id="tc-s-1700" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="See supra paras 395-397, 402."><sup>1083</sup></a> </p>
<p id="tc-s-1701"> 410.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, The Trial Chamber is mindful of having taken judicial notice of the Dragomir Milošević Trial Judgement finding that “ o n the basis of the evidence in its totality as admitted in the Milošević case the Milošević Trial Chamber is not satisfied that the mortar was launched from SRK-held territory”. However, this Trial Chamber notes that the evidence led in this case partially
differs from that led in the Milošević case.<a id="tc-s-1702" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Decision on Motion for Reconsideration of the Trial Chamber’s Decision of 4 May 2010 Concerning

Chamber includes the testimony of Per Anton Brennskag of the OP4 in relation to the UNMO Situation Report of 19 June 1995 identifying the origin of the fire in the SRK-held territory and the additional investigative evidence of Mirsad Kučanin.<a id="tc-s-1703" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="See supra para. 401."><sup>1085</sup></a> </p>
<p id="tc-s-1704"> 411.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, the Trial Chamber finds beyond a reasonable doubt that the shell which exploded at the Simon Bolivar School in Dobrinja was fired from the SRK-held area of Ned`arići. </p>
<p id="tc-s-1705"> 412.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Defence also avers – as an alternative argument – that the Prosecution failed to prove that the intent was to target civilians.<a id="tc-s-1706" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Defence Final Brief, para. 543."><sup>1086</sup></a> The Defence argues that the shell was fired amid an ongoing battle with a major ABiH offensive unfolding for the “break-out” of Sarajevo.

<p id="tc-s-1708"> 413.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Trial Chamber finds beyond a reasonable doubt that the VRS deliberately fired the shell on the Simon Bolivar School in Dobrinja and rejects the Defence argument based on the following considerations. </p>
<p id="tc-s-1709"> 414.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evidence shows that the ABiH launched an attack in Sarajevo on 16 June 1995 and that on 18 June 1995 ingoing and outgoing firing was recorded around Sarajevo before and after the

<p > 435.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Trial Chamber finds beyond a reasonable doubt that on 1 July 1995 at about 21:30 hours, a modified air bomb exploded at Bunićki Potok Street, injuring 13 persons. The Trial Chamber finds that the bomb fell in a civilian area of Hrasnica with no military activities nearby. The only reasonable inference is that all the victims were civilians not taking part in hostilities at the time. The Trial Chamber bases its conclusion on the fact that (i) the air bomb landed in a residential area and (ii) the victims included a housewife, a student, a business woman, three children, pensioners and UNMOs. </p>
<p id="tc-s-1821"> 436.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Trial Chamber notes that the evidence shows two alternative explanations of the manner of the shell explosion: one based on the double ricochet theory; the other that the bomb disassembled in flight, losing its propulsion system on Alekse Šantića Street at about 150 metres from where it finally landed and exploded. The Trial Chamber is unable to reach a conclusion beyond a reasonable doubt on this issue as both explanations, based on the evidence, appear plausible. Regardless of which of the two explanations is correct, the Trial Chamber is however satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the modified air bomb originated from the VRS held

The analysis of the data collected from the radar showed that a mortar shell fired from a distance of
900 metres from the impact zone would have reached a height on its trajectory which would have been registered by the radar beam. For the mortar shell which hit the City Market to pass undetected by the radar, its trajectory must have been lower than the radar beam, which meant that the shell had been fired from a position at a range between 1,550 and 3,500 metres, depending on the
propulsion charge.<a id="tc-s-1908" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Ex.

<h5> <u> (v) Findings </u> </h5>
<p id="tc-s-2262"> 503.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Trial Chamber finds beyond a reasonable doubt that on 10 December 1994 at around
11:00 hours, Derviša Selmanović was deliberately injured by a sniper bullet on the inner side of her right leg. In spite of her occupation as a cook assistant in the ABiH, the Trial Chamber is also satisfied that the victim was a civilian not taking part in hostilities at the time the sniping occurred. The Trial Chamber is further satisfied that the sniper shot originated from the Špicasta Stijena hill, which was a notorious sniper position of the VRS. </p>

<h5> <u> (v) Findings </u> </h5>
<p id="tc-s-2325"> 517.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Trial Chamber finds beyond a reasonable doubt that the tram, driven on 27 February
1995 by MP-229, was deliberately hit by sniper fire near the Marshal Tito barracks. As a result, Mulaosmanović-Čehajić and Alija Holjan sustained serious wounds, while Senad Kešmer was lightly wounded. The Trial Chamber is also satisfied that the only reasonable inference to be drawn from the evidence is that the victims were civilians not taking part in hostilities. The Trial Chamber also reached the only reasonable conclusion that the shots were fired from one of the high-rise buildings located on Lenjinova Street in Grbavica, which was under the control of the VRS at the relevant time. </p>

<h5> <u> (iv) Findings </u> </h5>
<p id="tc-s-2386"> 532.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Trial Chamber finds beyond a reasonable doubt that the tram, driven on 3 March 1995 by Slavica Livnjak, was deliberately hit by sniper fire in front of the Holiday Inn. The Trial Chamber also notes that the evidence shows that generally the trams were civilian vehicles not used for military purposes. The Trial Chamber is therefore satisfied that the only reasonable inference to be drawn from the evidence is that the victims were civilians not taking part in hostilities. The Trial Chamber also concludes that the shots were fired from the Metalka building in Grbavica, which was under the control of the VRS at the relevant time. </p>

<p id="tc-s-2396"> 534.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prosecution submits that “from May 1992 through November 1995, the SRK carried
out a protracted campaign of artillery and mortar shelling and sniping on the civilian areas and
population of Sarajevo” which includes the crimes alleged in the Indictment.<a id="tc-s-2397" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Prosecution Final Brief, para. 386"><sup>1583</sup></a> It also submits that the campaign was: (i) widespread as it resulted in the killings of “thousands of lives and the wounding of thousands more”; and (ii) systematic as the SRK “purposefully planned and attacked civilians in an assault spanning over three years”.<a id="tc-s-2398" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Ibid."><sup>1584</sup></a> </p>
<p id="tc-s-2399"> 535.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, the Prosecution submits that the campaign “was planned, instigated, ordered, committed and aided by”, inter alia, Stanislav Galić, Dragomir Milošević, Čedo Sladoje and Ratko Mladić.<a id="tc-s-2400" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Prosecution Final Brief, para. 387."><sup>1585</sup></a> </p>
<p id="tc-s-2401"> 536.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Defence does not dispute that civilians in Sarajevo – on both sides of the confrontation lines – were targeted during the conflict period. However, it is the Defence position that “these findings benefit from over fifteen years of investigation, examination, and litigation” and that a conclusion about the campaign “could not be reached with such ease during the conflict”.<a id="tc-s-2402" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Defence Final Brief, para. 554."><sup>1586</sup></a> The Defence also argues that – against the backdrop of substantial “propaganda”, “the perception of a
biased international community, and a pitched battle for the city itself” – it was reasonable to believe at the time that there was no such campaign and that “civilian casualties were legitimate collateral damage to an on-going conflict”.<a id="tc-s-2403" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Ibid."><sup>1587</sup></a> The Defence also emphasises that a “propaganda
war” unfolded in Sarajevo with the media presenting only “one side of the story”.<a id="tc-s-2404" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Defence Final Brief, paras 566-567."><sup>1588</sup></a> Hence, it is

<p id="tc-s-2406"> 537.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Trial Chamber has to determine, at this juncture, whether the evidence is sufficient to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that there was a campaign of shelling and sniping on the civilian population as alleged in the Indictment.<a id="tc-s-2407" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Indictment, paras 40-42."><sup>1590</sup></a> In this context, the Trial Chamber finds that the question raised by the Defence on what was “reasonable to believe” or “perceived” at the time of the shelling is immaterial. The Trial Chamber however deems that such question might be relevant
to the issue of whether Vuković had any knowledge with respect to the events in Sarajevo. It will thus address this issue in the section of the Judgement devoted to the Accused’s individual criminal

<p id="tc-s-2424"> 541.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Defence submits several arguments to rebut the existence of a campaign of sniping and shelling against civilians. The Trial Chamber dismisses these arguments for the reasons given below. </p>
<p id="tc-s-2425"> 542.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Defence argues that there were “often instances of intense fighting” between the SRK
and the ABiH and this “may have resulted in collateral damage to civilians and civilian areas”.<a id="tc-s-2426" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Defence Final Brief, para. 561."><sup>1604</sup></a>

government violated the laws of war. Notably, that they: (i) were accused of shelling and sniping against their own civilians and blamed the VRS;<a id="tc-s-2428" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Defence Final Brief, para. 566."><sup>1606</sup></a> (ii) used civilian buildings or areas to fire shells on Serbian-controlled areas;<a id="tc-s-2429" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Defence Final Brief, para. 573."><sup>1607</sup></a> (iii) used vehicles painted in the same colour as UNPROFOR;<a id="tc-s-2430" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Ibid."><sup>1608</sup></a> and (iv) according to rumours, “planted bodies at crime scenes” to give “further credence to the notion of the propaganda war being waged by the Bosnian Government”.<a id="tc-s-2431" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Ibid."><sup>1609</sup></a> </p>
<p id="tc-s-2432"> 543.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Trial Chamber dismisses the argument that intense fighting between the SRK and the ABiH “may have resulted” in collateral damage to civilians as it is speculative.<a id="tc-s-2433" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Defence Final Brief, para. 461 (emphasis added). See also Defence Final Brief, para. 544."><sup>1610</sup></a> Furthermore, the Trial Chamber finds that the Scheduled Incidents discussed above show a targeted aim at the victims while there were no hostilities, rather than a collateral damage. The Trial Chamber also
finds speculative the other Defence arguments insofar as they refer to “accusations” or “rumours”. </p>
<p id="tc-s-2434"> 544.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect to the Defence argument regarding the ABiH military presence in Sarajevo’s neighbourhoods, the Trial Chamber recalls the evidence demonstrating that the SRK shelled often civilian areas despite the absence of any military activity or presence.<a id="tc-s-2435" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="See supra paras 319-323, 326 and section V.A.4."><sup>1611</sup></a> </p>
<p id="tc-s-2436"> 545.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, the accusation that the ABiH shelled its own civilians – even if proven – is related to isolated events that took place in early 1995. Similarly, the Defence allegations that the ABiH used civilian or UNPROFOR buildings or areas to fire shells on Serb-controlled areas refer to isolated incidents concentrated in January 1993,<a id="tc-s-2437" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Ex.

August 1995 until 10 September 1995. The Trial Chamber is also satisfied that in turn during his tenure as VRS Commander, Mladić had effective control over his subordinates in the VRS, including the SRK. </p>
<h3 id="tc-s-2477" class="text-center"> <u> 8. Legal Findings </u> </h3>
<p id="tc-s-2478"> 556.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Indictment charges the Accused with murder and attacks on civilians as a violation of the laws or customs of war (Counts 2 and 4), and murder and inhumane acts as a crime against humanity (Counts 1 and 3). </p>
<h4> <u> (a) Crimes under Article 3 of the Statute </u> </h4>
<p id="tc-s-2479"> 557.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not disputed that an armed conflict existed in Sarajevo between the ABiH and the VRS during the Indictment period and that the crimes which Vuković is charged with were closely related to the conflict and committed against the civilian population of Sarajevo during that period.<a id="tc-s-2480" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="See Prosecution Final Brief, para. 386; Defence Final Brief, paras 556-563. See supra paras 306, 311, 534, 536."><sup>1641</sup></a> </p>
<p id="tc-s-2481"> 558.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Trial Chamber finds that the attacks by sniping and shelling were conducted against the civilian population and individual civilians not taking part in hostilities. These acts resulted in death or serious injury within the civilian population. The Trial Chamber further finds that these acts were carried out by SRK forces and wilfully directed against civilians, that is, either deliberately against
civilians or through recklessness. </p>
 
<p id="tc-s-2482"> 559.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Trial Chamber is therefore satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the crimes of murder and attacks on civilians for Counts 2 and 4 have been established for the Scheduled Incidents described in Schedules A and B of the Indictment, save for Scheduled Incidents A4, B7 and B12. </p>
<h4> <u> (b) Offences under Article 5 of the Statute </u> </h4>
<p id="tc-s-2483"> 560.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Trial Chamber finds that the crimes committed in Sarajevo during the Indictment period formed part of an attack directed against the civilian population and that this attack was widespread and systematic. The Trial Chamber is also satisfied that the crimes committed by the SRK formed part of that attack and that the perpetrators knew of the attack and that the crimes were part of it. </p>
<p id="tc-s-2484"> 561.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Trial Chamber is further satisfied that murder and inhumane acts falling within the meaning of Article 5 of the Statute for Counts 1 and 3 were committed in Sarajevo during the Indictment period. </p>
<p id="tc-s-2485"> 562.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Trial Chamber therefore finds that key VRS officers, including Mladić, Galić and Dragomir Milošević were involved in the commission of the crimes in Sarajevo by devising and implementing a campaign of sniping and shelling on civilians, which was an integral part to the siege of Sarajevo. The Trial Chamber found that the crimes committed by VRS members, under the effective control of these VRS officers, constituted murder and attacks on civilians as violation of the laws or customs of war (Counts 2 and 4), and murder and inhumane acts as crimes against humanity (Counts 1 and 3). The Trial Chamber is therefore satisfied that these key officers and their subordinates committed the charged crimes. </p>
<p id="tc-s-2486"> 563.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The issue of whether the Accused bears responsibility for these crimes will be addressed separately.
