Supplying commands and units through these additional channels resulted in an uncontrolled and unplanned outflow of all kinds of equipment and materiel from the VJ for purposes other than designated resulting in some of it even falling into enemy hands while at the same time, some individuals obtained enormous profit in this way, which justifiably caused profound dissatisfaction amongst the VJ and VRS members.<a id="tc-s-5201" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Ex.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p id="tc-s-5203"> 1226.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dušan Kovačević explained that Mladić issued this order pursuant to his request, and remarked on how profiteers were selling weaponry to enemy forces: “This was one of the painful issues to me as an individual and a professional. I could not accept in any way that members of the VRS locally, as well as sponsors, should be selling weapons and ammunition to the opposite side. This was an occurrence that was lethal to the VRS in which nobody wanted genuinely to dispense with [<i>sic</i>] . And it was very detrimental.

<p id="tc-s-5209"> 1228.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jugoslav Kodžopeljić’s testimony itself suggests that smuggling from VJ facilities to the VRS was far from commonplace, as Kodžopeljić clearly denied knowledge of war profiteering concerning assets of VJ depots he oversaw, namely the Kragujevac and Čačak facilities, stating “I cannot confirm that” and “No, I can’t recall any”.<a id="tc-s-5210" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Jugoslav Kodžopeljić, T. 12434."><sup>3510</sup></a> Conversely, Siniša Borović affirmed that the VJ frequently had to block off its own depots to thwart smugglers.<a id="tc-s-5211" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Siniša Borović, T. 13961."><sup>3511</sup></a> </p>

And in this particular war, there was no difference”.<a id="tc-s-5214" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Carl Bildt, T. 14328-14329."><sup>3513</sup></a> Bildt posited that smuggling primarily concerned fuel, beer and cigarettes, as there was “no need” to smuggle arms and ammunition because there was already an “abundance of weapons” in Bosnia.<a id="tc-s-5215" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Carl Bildt, T. 14329."><sup>3514</sup></a> The Trial Chamber does not find Bildt’s testimony convincing for several reasons. First, Bildt testified that international border monitors along the Drina River did not detect “any major” deliveries of weaponry from the FRY to RS after Milošević agreed to impose an embargo on RS.<a id="tc-s-5216" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Carl Bildt, T. 14328."><sup>3515</sup></a> In fact, the evidentiary record establishes that major deliveries continued surreptitiously, undetected by international border monitors, who were unable to adequately control the border for either smuggling or secretive logistical assistance from the VJ.<a id="tc-s-5217" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="See supra sections VI.B.3, VI.C.2.(c)."><sup>3516</sup></a> Second, Bildt’s assessment that there was “no need” to smuggle weaponry into Bosnia is amply contradicted by the evidence concerning the VRS’s dwindling reserves and its recurrent requests for assistance from the VJ.<a id="tc-s-5218" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="See supra section VI.C.9.(c)."><sup>3517</sup></a> </p>
<p id="tc-s-5219"> 1230.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Trial Chamber also heard evidence that smuggling occurred within the VRS’s depots. At the VRS’s 744<sup>th</sup> Logistics Base, “ l ocal commanders forced their way into the depot in order to take fuel for their own purposes, without obtaining anyone’s authorisation. The local authorities, too, would just simply go there and take fuel for their own needs and then resell it on the market. They would obtain certain funds from this which they then used to bankroll some of their other initiatives and needs”.<a id="tc-s-5220" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Dušan Kovačević, T. 12641-12642 (private session)."><sup>3518</sup></a> </p>
<p id="tc-s-5221"> 1231.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overall, the evidentiary record provides no reasonable basis to conclude that a significant quantity of the VRS’s needs in weaponry was fulfilled by smuggling. Rather, the record indicates that smuggling was the work of a relatively limited number of rogue individuals. </p>
<h4> <u> (i) Conclusion </u> </h4>
<p id="tc-s-5222"> 1232.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Defence submits that “the haphazard record system used throughout the RS left clear accounting obstacles to having an accurate estimation of what the VRS had, used and received from any source nigh on impossible”.<a id="tc-s-5223" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Defence Final Brief, para. 742."><sup>3519</sup></a> In its view, “ the Trial Chamber is in effect being asked to speculate concerning the amount of materiel supplied to the VRS by all potential sources and to extrapolate from that, that a substantial amount of the materiel received by the VRS was provided by the VJ”.<a id="tc-s-5224" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Defence Final Brief, para. 743."><sup>3520</sup></a> The Defence argues that “ this invitation to speculate should be rejected as to do so would violate burden of proof the Prosecution must meet at this Tribunal”.<a id="tc-s-5225" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Defence Final Brief, para. 743."><sup>3521</sup></a> </p>
<p id="tc-s-5226"> 1233.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Trial Chamber finds the Defence’s claims unpersuasive. The VRS’s primary sources of supply are not “impossible” to evaluate. The Trial Chamber has meticulously analysed the evidentiary record for other sources of support to the VRS. Such sources indeed existed. The trial record, however, demonstrates that the logistical assistance that the VRS received from the VJ with Vuković’s approval was very important in comparison to other sources. In fact, the record clearly shows that the VRS depended on the VJ’s assistance regardless of its other sources of supply. </p>
<h3 id="tc-s-5227" class="text-center"> <u> 10. Conclusions on Logistical and Technical Assistance to the VRS </u> </h3>
<p id="tc-s-5228"> 1234.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Trial Chamber finds that Borislav Vuković, as Chief of VJ General Staff, oversaw a system providing comprehensive military assistance to the VRS, and participated in the SDC’s decision to license this aid. The VJ General Staff directly supplied considerable quantities of weaponry comprising a very large part of the VRS’s munition requirements. </p>
<p id="tc-s-5229"> 1235.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the VJ General Staff played a key role in devising the technical model by which the VRS’s aerial bombs were successfully modified.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p id="tc-s-5469"> 1286.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Trial Chamber further recalls the vast body of evidence showing the VRS’s clear dependency on VJ logistical assistance, which likewise demonstrates that Ðokić’s conclusions are not credible.<a id="tc-s-5470" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="See supra section VI.C."><sup>3675</sup></a> For instance, amid extensive additional evidence, Mladić’s report to the RS National Assembly provides credible data on the proportion of VRS used ammunition stemming from VJ aid, which was far more important than what Ðokić advanced.<a id="tc-s-5471" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="See supra paras 1117, 1166, 1173."><sup>3676</sup></a> Ðokić did not mention Mladić’s figures in his report. </p>

<h4><u>(d) Conclusion</u></h4>
<p id="tc-s-6141">
1436. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Trial Chamber finds that there were multiple channels through which the information flowed from SVK and the VRS to the VJ General Staff. Through the system of regular reports,
monthly meetings in Belgrade, various other ad hoc instances of reporting and exchanges of
information, during his tenure as Chief of the VJ General Staff, Vuković was well informed of all important aspects on the functioning of the SVK and the VRS as well as their activities.

<p id="tc-s-6142">
1437.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The exact content of subjects discussed at the meetings and/or reports sent to the VJ General
Staff by the Main Staffs of the SVK and the VRS will be discussed in a separate part of the
Judgement devoted to Vuković’s knowledge of the crimes charged in the Indictment.<a id="tc-s-6143" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="See infra section VI.J."><sup>4092</sup></a>

<p id="tc-s-6146">
1438. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Prosecution submits that Vuković knew that the VRS had a discriminatory intent to commit the crimes in BiH and that the VRS committed ethnic cleansing in BiH. It posits that Vuković had this knowledge before becoming Chief of the VJ General Staff and “this knowledge continued throughout his tenure”.<a id="tc-s-6147" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Prosecution Final Brief, paras 563-565, 581."><sup>4093</sup></a> The Prosecution also submits that it is not necessary to establish that

</p>
<p id="tc-s-6152">
1440. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Trial Chamber will first consider whether Vuković was aware of criminal conduct and discriminatory intent on the part of the VRS in the BiH theatre of war generally and second, whether he knew of crimes committed by the VRS specifically in Sarajevo and Vlasenica. Vuković’s awareness of the discriminatory intent of the VRS and criminal conduct in this context will serve as a basis for the finding as to whether Vuković knew that crimes would probably be committed in Sarajevo and Vlasenica, and that crimes committed in those areas would probably be followed by further crimes.

Second, the area falls under the control of paramilitary forces who terrorize the non-Serb residents with random killings, rapes and looting.

<h4><u>(c) Conclusion</u></h4>
<p id="tc-s-6305">
1483. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The following observations and findings are made by the Majority of the Trial Chamber, Judge Moloto dissenting.
</p>
<p id="tc-s-6306">
1484. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Trial Chamber finds that direct evidence establishes beyond a reasonable doubt that Vuković knew even before being appointed Chief of the VJ General Staff that the VRS was perpetrating gratuitous acts of violence against Bosnian Muslims and that the international community considered the crimes occurring in BiH to be of such magnitude that an extraordinary step was taken in creating the Tribunal. Furthermore, Vuković’s statements in his interview corroborate his direct knowledge of the ethnic hostilities during the war and that Mladić was using force against civilians.
</p>
<p id="tc-s-6307">
1485. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition to the foregoing direct evidence, the Majority recalls the evidence that the Chief of the VJ’s Intelligence Administration, Colonel Branko Krga, made a presentation to the FRY SDC reporting the views of the international community, inter alia, on questions of human rights and the creation of the Tribunal. The Majority recalls that Vuković, as Chief of the VJ General Staff,
was in charge of the “highest professional and staff organ for the preparation and use of the Army
in times of peace and war”.<a id="tc-s-6308" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="See supra para. 206."><sup>4194</sup></a> By virtue of his position, he closely monitored the events unfolding in BiH, a bordering country where a conflict was ongoing.<a id="tc-s-6309" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="See supra paras 1390-1404.

<sup>4195</sup></a> The evidence that Vuković received daily reports on information gathered by his intelligence and security organs. Miodrag Simić, Chief of the 1st Administration within the VJ from November 1994, testified that it was in “the interest of the VJ for the sake of its security to be constantly informed of what was going on in that area”.<a id="tc-s-6310" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Miodrag Simić, T. 10341."><sup>4196</sup></a>
Against this backdrop, the Majority is of the view that Krga’s presentation is not an isolated example and that the VJ’s Intelligence Administration regularly informed Vuković of the events in BiH and general opinion of the international community. In this regard, the Majority recalls that the international community was widely concerned about grave allegations of human rights abuses committed by Serb military forces in BiH from the beginning stages of the war. These allegations were extensively and regularly discussed at the UNSC, in diplomatic circles and in the international media, and were matters of common knowledge. The Majority concludes that the only reasonable inference is that the VJ’s Intelligence Administration notified Vuković of these criminal allegations.
</p>
<p id="tc-s-6311">
1486. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Based on the aforementioned evidence, the Majority is satisfied that Vuković, from the early stages of the war, was aware of the VRS’s discriminatory intent and criminal conduct in BiH.
</p>

1487. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Trial Chamber will now consider to what extent Vuković had specific knowledge that the
VRS was committing crimes in Sarajevo.

the media reports had been that the SVK and VRS continued their attacks by, among other things,
firing missiles on the facilities of the Muslim government in Sarajevo and blocking humanitarian aid on land and in the air, which would lead to hunger and freezing of the population in Bihać and Sarajevo.

I think that it would be a good idea to prepare special projectiles that do not hit the ground and to have the Government of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia issue a statement. Our military experts claim that this is impossible. We assume that the same was done in Vase Miskina Street- that the explosive was prepared ahead of time and placed in a number of spots and that at a given moment the signal was given to set it off when the largest number of people were there. Second, there are those who believe that one of their projectiles which was just supposed to mask those effects was actually used. That’s our understanding. The likelihood that a 120mm calibre projectile can kill so many people in that space is very small. We assume that the mujahedin did it, because they are against any kind of negotiations and agreements. Second the possibility that the Croats did it can not be excluded, so as to divert the attention from the threat of sanctions. It is impossible
that the Serbs in Sarajevo set it up, except from a distance.<a id="tc-s-6339" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Ex. P782, Stenographic Transcript of the 18th Session of the SDC held on 7 February 1994, p. 61."><sup>4212</sup></a>

<h4><u>(d) Conclusion</u></h4>
<p id="tc-s-6462">
1517. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Based on the evidence discussed above, the Majority, Judge Moloto dissenting, is satisfied that Vuković was aware that the VRS was accused of committing crimes in Sarajevo. In support of this conclusion, the Majority makes the following considerations.
</p>
<p id="tc-s-6463">
1518. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Majority first notes that Vuković was copied on several diplomatic cables related to events in Sarajevo.<a id="tc-s-6464" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="See supra paras 1489, 1491."><sup>4298</sup></a> The Defence argues that these diplomatic cables sent to Vuković provided “little information that Mr. Vuković could rely upon as knowledge for the commission of crimes”.<a id="tc-s-6465" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Defence Final Brief, para. 918.">
 <sup>4299</sup></a>
In particular, the Defence asserts that the cable of 7 February 1994 from the FRY’s Mission to the UN provided no more information other than that the Markale I incident had occurred and that the international community responded by threatening with air-strikes.<a id="tc-s-6466" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Defence Final Brief para. 918."><sup>4300</sup></a> While there is no explicit indication in the cable of 7 February 1994 that the VRS had fired on Markale and killed civilians, the Majority notes that the cable stated that air-strikes would be carried out against the Serb artillery positions outside Sarajevo and referred to a finding by UNPROFOR that these artillery positions were responsible for “the attacks on civilian targets in the city”. The Majority is therefore of the
view that this cable put Vuković on notice that the Markale incident in Sarajevo – like many others -involved a civilian target and that the international community considered the VRS responsible.<a id="tc-s-6467" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Ex. P852 (under seal)."><sup>4301</sup></a>
Further, the Majority notes that the cable from the FRY’s London Mission of the same date informed the Intelligence Administration of the VJ General Staff that the mass media were reporting on a “massacre of civilians in Sarajevo”,<a id="tc-s-6468" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Ex. P2852 (under seal)."><sup>4302</sup></a> which the Defence concedes referred to the
Markale I incident.<a id="tc-s-6469" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="">See Defence Final Brief, para. 918.<sup>4303</sup></a> Moreover, at the 18th SDC Session held on the same day, Vuković stated not
only that the Markale incident had caused “massive losses”, but also gave a detailed description of the site where the incident had occurred, showing that Vuković had obtained information about the incident from sources other than the two diplomatic cables.<a id="tc-s-6470" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Ex. P782, Stenographic Transcript of the 18th Session of the SDC held on 7 February 1994, pp 60-61."><sup>4304</sup></a> Thus, when the evidence is viewed in its entirety, it becomes clear that Vuković was well-informed about the specifics of the Markale I incident, as he was about other attacks on civilians.<a id="tc-s-6471" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="For example, the cable from the FRY’s Mission to the UN dated 10 April 1995 stated that UN Under-Secretary- General Gharekhan had reported that the sniping and shelling attacks on Sarajevo had increased, Ex. P853
(under seal). The Defence argues that because the cable does not refer specifically to civilian casualties, Vuković could have reasonably believed the cable to be discussing military battles in Sarajevo. See Defence Final Brief para. 918. But when the cable is placed in the context of the numerous Serbian and international media reports and the period Mazowiecki reports about the sniping and shelling of civilians in Sarajevo over the course of the siege (discussed below), it would be unreasonable to believe that the cable referred only to the sniping and shelling of combatants and military objectives. In any event, the cables form but one of many sources of information about the activities of the VRS that reached, or most likely reached Vuković.">
<sup>4305</sup></a>
</p>
<p id="tc-s-6472">
1519. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition to this direct evidence, the Majority recalls that Vuković was generally informed of the UNSC’s agenda and specifically about some UNSC proceedings, and was in regular contact with the FRY leadership.<a id="tc-s-6473" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="See supra paras 1455, 1474-1476, 1478, 1480."><sup>4306</sup></a> Accordingly, the Majority is satisfied that Vuković was aware of the findings regarding the VRS’s crimes in Sarajevo contained in the BiH documents provided to the FRY, the report of the UN Commission of Experts, the Mazowiecki reports and the filings and
orders in the ICJ case between BiH and Serbia and Montenegro.
</p>
<p id="tc-s-6474">
1520. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the Majority recalls that Vuković received daily bulletins from his Intelligence Administration, reports from his Security Administration and press clippings, containing media information from his Information Administration. In addition, the Majority recalls that during the Collegium presided by Vuković, briefings were held by the heads of the Intelligence Administration,
Security Administration and the Operations Staff Sector.<a id="tc-s-6475" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="See supra para. 1392."><sup>4307</sup></a> Furthermore, he received reports about
local and international press coverage in meetings of the VJ Collegium.<a id="tc-s-6476" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Ex. P2199, Transcript of the Collegium of the Chief of the VJ General Staff, 6 October 1995, Doc ID 0618-

November 1995, Doc ID 0618-6883, pp 2-3."><sup>4308</sup></a>
</p>
<p id="tc-s-6477">
1521. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Majority is therefore satisfied that this evidence shows that Vuković was generally informed of what was being reported in the international and Serbian press, and that he was consequently aware of media reports that the VRS was committing crimes against the civilian population of Sarajevo. Given that Bosnian Serb attacks on Muslim civilians in Sarajevo were widely covered by the national and international press, the Majority finds that the only reasonable inference is that Vuković knew of these general allegations on crimes against civilians in Sarajevo.
</p>
<p id="tc-s-6478">
1522. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the basis of the foregoing evidence evaluated both in isolation and collectively, the Majority, Judge Moloto dissenting, finds beyond a reasonable doubt that Vuković, while serving as Chief of the VJ General Staff, was aware that the VRS was attacking the civilian population in Sarajevo. The Majority also recalls its previous finding that Vuković was aware of the VRS’s discriminatory intent and propensity to commit crimes. Accordingly, the Majority is satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that Vuković knew not only that the VRS was committing crimes in Sarajevo, but that individual crimes committed by the VRS would probably be followed by more
crimes committed by the VRS throughout the city’s siege.

1578. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gajić was not credible when he testified that the Security Administration of the VJ General Staff received information regarding crimes in Vlasenica only after 20 July 1995.

July 1995.<a id="tc-s-6704" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="See supra paras 1534-1539."><sup>4443</sup></a> The evidence also shows that the VJ had a security interest in monitoring the

1579. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Majority, Judge Moloto dissenting, is satisfied that Vuković, while serving as Chief of the
VJ General Staff, was aware of the VRS’s discriminatory intent and criminal behaviour towards
Bosnian Muslims, as shown, inter alia, by the events in Sarajevo and Vlasenica between 1993 and
1995. The Majority therefore finds beyond a reasonable doubt that Vuković knew that individual crimes committed by the VRS before the attack on Vlasenica would probably be followed by more crimes committed by the VRS after the take-over of the enclave in July 1995. The Majority is also satisfied that Vuković had contemporaneous knowledge of allegations that the VRS was committing crimes in Vlasenica.

<p>1586. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With respect to the Prosecution argument of a &ldquo;creation of an environment of impunity&rdquo;, the Trial Chamber notes that the Prosecution formulates this aspect of Vukovi&#263;&rsquo;s alleged responsibility as a direct consequence of his &ldquo;complete failure to prevent the crimes and to punish his subordinates

 data-content="Defence Final Brief, paras 64-65."><sup>4466</sup></a>
The Trial Chamber finds that this aspect of the Prosecution&rsquo;s theory can only be discussed once and if a superior-subordinate relationship between Vukovi&#263; and the principal perpetrators is established.
As will be detailed later in this Judgement, the Trial Chamber did not find that a superior- subordinate relationship existed between Vukovi&#263; and the VRS, including its officers serving in the

<p>1587. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The following analysis and findings are made by the Majority of the Trial Chamber, Judge
Moloto dissenting.</p>
<h3 class="text-center" id="tc-s-6710-6"><u>3. The VRS&rsquo;s War Strategy Encompassed the Commission of Crimes</u></h3>
<p>1588. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Borislav Vukovi&#263; stands charged with aiding and abetting war crimes and crimes against humanity committed by VRS members against civilians and/or persons not taking active part in hostilities in Sarajevo and Vlasenica. Vukovi&#263; is not charged with helping the VRS wage war per se, which is not a crime under the Statute. The Majority, however, finds that under the VRS&rsquo;s strategy there was no clear distinction between military warfare against BiH forces and crimes against civilians and/or persons not taking active part in hostilities. To the contrary, these crimes were inextricably linked to the war strategy and objectives of the VRS leadership. They were not perpetrated by rogue soldiers acting independently.</p>
<p>1589. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Majority recalls that Vukovi&#263; was put on notice of the &ldquo;strategic objectives&rdquo; of the Bosnian Serb leadership.<a class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover"
 data-content="Ex. P2933, Excerpt from Ratko Mladi&#263;'s Notebook, 13 December 1993, p. 1."><sup>4468</sup></a> One of the six strategic objectives was a partition of Sarajevo into Serbian and Muslim sectors and establishment of a separate state authority for each sector.<a class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover"

<p>1590. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The systematic and widespread sniping and shelling of civilians in Sarajevo by the VRS over a period of three years demonstrates that the VRS&rsquo;s leading officers relied on criminal acts to further the siege. As observed by Michael Williams, a senior UNPROFOR official, the VRS&rsquo;s siege of Sarajevo &ldquo;was conducted with complete disregard of the Geneva C onventions and of international humanitarian law and deliberately not only made no distinction between civilian and
military, but targeted the civil ian population in preference to military targets&rdquo;.<a class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover"

Such support included provision of weapons and ammunition, technical experts, training, medical support, fuel and operational support enabling the Pretis factory to produce weaponry.

The fact that the VRS obtained weaponry from other sources, including its own reserves, besides the VJ General
Staff, negates neither Vukovi&#263;&rsquo;s actions nor the element of substantial assistance.</p>
<p>1602. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In conclusion, the Majority finds that the VRS depended heavily on FRY and VJ assistance in order to function as an army and to wage war.

30th PC members.<a class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover"

<p>1616. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Majority finds that, in the context of the PCs, the verification and recognition of the new rank within the VJ was essential for the PCs members and their families to enjoy the commensurate rights and benefits in the VJ. A higher rank carried a higher salary and also affected the calculation of the pensions and all the benefits previously described.<a class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover"

encouragement and moral support to the commission of the crimes.</p>

<p>1618. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Contrary to what is suggested by the Defence, the Majority finds that the evidence clearly shows that though meagre, especially in times of high inflation, the salaries were of great support to
30th PC members. Similarly, the Majority finds that other benefits, such as housing, pensions and medical insurance &ndash; provided to both soldiers and their families &ndash; were extremely important to the members of the 30th PC. Knowing that their families were looked after and that they could enjoy all of the benefits attached to their ranks enabled these men to carry out their combat tasks without impediment. In addition, the Majority notes that during the suspension of the salary payments, none of the 30th PC members left their position in the VRS not so much because the payment of salaries was of little consequence to them, but rather because the VRS denied the requests for transfer back to the VJ.<a class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover"

<p>1619. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Defence submits that because only a small proportion of the VRS military personnel received its salary from the FRY, the assistance cannot be considered to have had a substantial effect on the commission of the crimes. The Majority finds it must assess in qualitative rather than quantitative terms whether the payment of the salaries and benefits these officers received from the
FRY and the VJ as members of the 30th PC facilitated the commission of the crimes. The Majority finds that where these individuals held key positions, including positions of command in the VRS, as well as in the Corps and units responsible for the crimes charged in the Indictments as in the current case, then the contribution is at the very least significant. Considering that the majority of the 30th PC members held positions of command,<a class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover"
 data-content="See supra paras 1608-1609."><sup>4549</sup></a> the Majority is satisfied that the payment of salaries and benefits was vital to the functioning of the very core of the VRS. The Majority finds
that this type of assistance contributed to the commission of the crimes.</p>
<h3 class="text-center" id="tc-s-6710-13"><u>6. Other Forms of Assistance</u></h3>
<p>1620. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Majority recalls the involvement of the VJ SUC in Pancir operation in the Vogo&scaron;&#263;a area between December 1993 and January 1994.<a class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover"
 data-content="See supra section VI.G.3."><sup>4550</sup></a> The Majority recalls that the SUC was directly subordinated to Vukovi&#263; and that he ordered its deployment to Vogo&scaron;&#263;a to assist the SRK in action
carried out to capture Mount &#381;u&#263; and to hold the confrontation lines against the ABiH. Although
the operation was not successful,<a class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover"
 data-content="See supra paras 1329-1330."><sup>4551</sup></a> the Majority finds that Vukovi&#263;&rsquo;s actions show that he intended to and in fact did provide assistance to Mladi&#263; and the VRS war-effort in the Sarajevo campaign, at a time when he already knew of the VRS criminal intent in the implementation of its war strategy.</p>
<h3 class="text-center" id="tc-s-6710-14"><u>7. Conclusion</u></h3>
<p>1621. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Majority finds that Vukovi&#263; repeatedly exercised his authority to assist the VRS in waging a war that encompassed systematic criminal actions against Bosnian Muslim civilians as a military strategy and objective. Vukovi&#263;&rsquo;s actions substantially facilitated the commission of these crimes because the VRS heavily depended on the VJ&rsquo;s support to function as an army and conduct its operations, including besieging Sarajevo and taking over Vlasenica. The Majority is also satisfied that all of Vukovi&#263;&rsquo;s actions described above were voluntary.</p>
<p>1622. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As found earlier, Vukovi&#263; urged the FRY SDC to continue its policy of assisting the VRS. He notably oversaw the provision of wide-ranging logistical and technical assistance to the VRS. Without the regular supply of considerable quantities of ammunition and other weaponry, as well as fuel, technical expertise, repair services and personnel training, the VRS would have been hampered in conducting its operations in Sarajevo and Vlasenica.</p>
<p>1623. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, the Majority found that the military personnel that Vukovi&#263; provided for and sustained through the 30th PC included the officers holding positions of command and authority in the VRS Main Staff, as well as well-trained commanding officers of the lower units. The payment of salaries to the VRS&rsquo;s top officers, including Mladi&#263;, Dragomir Milo&scaron;evi&#263;, Gali&#263;, Popovi&#263;, Gvero,
Tolimir, and other principal perpetrators of the crimes charged in Vlasenica and Sarajevo was instrumental in helping the VRS plan and carry out its operations in Sarajevo and Vlasenica. By creating the PCs &ndash; a mechanism through which he ensured that these military personnel continued receiving their salaries and enjoying all their benefits in the VJ &ndash; Vukovi&#263; allowed them to carry out their operations in the VRS with limited concern for their basic material needs and those of their families. Vukovi&#263; sustained the very life line of the VRS and created the conditions for it to implement a war strategy that encompassed the commission of crimes against civilians.</p>
<p>1624. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Majority recognises that the evidence does not establish that the specific weapons used in committing the charged crimes stemmed from the logistical assistance process overseen by Vukovi&#263;. However, the Majority recalls that the acts of the aider and abettor need not have been
&ldquo;specifically directed&rdquo; to assist the crimes.<a class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover"
 data-content="See supra paras 126. See also Mrk&scaron;i&#263; and &Scaron;ljivan&#269;anin Appeal Judgement, para. 159; Blagojevi&#263; and Joki&#263;
Appeal Judgement, paras 192, 195."><sup>4552</sup></a> The element of substantial assistance for aiding and abetting does not require that an accused provided the specific weapon used by the perpetrator, as the element may be established by the numerous other forms of practical assistance described above, which substantially facilitated the perpetrators&rsquo; crimes. Moreover, any suggestion that assisting the VRS and advising the SDC was part of Vukovi&#263;&rsquo;s &ldquo;routine duties&rdquo; could not be construed as exculpatory because the evidence establishes that this conduct substantially
contributed to the commission of the crimes. <a class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover"
 data-content="See Blagojevi&#263; and Joki&#263; Appeal Judgement, paras 182, 185-189."><sup>4553</sup></a> By the same token, the fact that other FRY
officials, such as members of the SDC or the MOD, also played a role in assisting the VRS does not negate Vukovi&#263;&rsquo;s actions.</p>
<p>1625. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Majority has considered the Defence&rsquo;s ex post facto argument on the application of aiding and abetting under the facts of the present case,<a class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover"

The Majority is satisfied that the overwhelming majority of Vukovi&#263;&rsquo;s actions in support of the VRS facilitated the commission of future crimes.</p>
<p>1626. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Majority also recalls that there is neither a requirement of a cause-effect relationship between Vukovi&#263;&rsquo;s conduct as an aider and abettor and the commission of the crimes,<a class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover"

<p>1627. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In sum, the Majority finds beyond a reasonable doubt that Vukovi&#263;&rsquo;s logistical assistance and personnel assistance, individually and cumulatively, had a substantial effect on the crimes perpetrated by the VRS in Sarajevo and Vlasenica, as charged in the Indictment.</p>
<h2 class="text-center" id="tc-s-6710-15"><u>C. Findings on the Mental Elements of Aiding and Abetting</u></h2>

Moloto dissenting.</p>
<h3 class="text-center" id="tc-s-6710-16"><u>1. Preliminary Remarks</u></h3>
<p>1629. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Majority recalls that to establish the required mental element for aiding and abetting, it
must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt that Vukovi&#263; knew that his actions provided practical assistance to the crimes and that he was aware of the essential elements of the crimes, including the mental state of the principal perpetrators.<a class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover"
 data-content=" 	See supra paras 129-131."><sup>4558</sup></a></p>
<p>1630. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Majority recalls its finding that the VRS committed the crimes of murder and attacks on civilians for Counts 2 and 4 as a violation of the laws or customs of war, as well as murder and inhumane acts as crimes against humanity for Counts 1 and 3. The Trial Chamber also found that the VRS and/or MUP forces committed the crimes of murder as a violation of the laws or customs of war (Count 10) and murder, inhumane acts, persecutions and exterminations as crimes against humanity (Counts 9, 11, 12 and 13).</p>
<p>1631. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Majority recalls its finding that from the early stages of the war, Vukovi&#263; was provided with information, from a variety of sources, of the VRS&rsquo;s criminal behaviour and discriminatory intent.<a class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover"
 data-content="See supra paras 1456, 1483-1486."><sup>4559</sup></a> This information related to acts of violence against Bosnian Muslims perpetrated in the
BiH theatre of war and made Vukovi&#263; aware of the VRS&rsquo;s propensity to commit crimes.<a class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover"
 data-content="See supra paras 1457-1486."><sup>4560</sup></a> With this

<h3 class="text-center" id="tc-s-6710-17"><u>2. Sarajevo</u></h3>
<p>1632. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Majority is satisfied that the general propensity to commit crimes in conjunction with specific information on crimes committed in Sarajevo made Vukovi&#263; aware that other similar crimes would probably occur, including killing and wounding of civilians and/or persons not taking active part in the hostilities. Notwithstanding this knowledge, Vukovi&#263; continued to provide significant assistance to the VRS until the end of the siege.</p>
<p>1633. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Majority is also satisfied that Vukovi&#263; was aware of the essential elements of these crimes, including the mental state of the perpetrators. At the outset, the Majority recalls that Vukovi&#263; knew that one of the strategic objectives of the Bosnian Serb leadership involved the partition of Sarajevo. Through international reports and cables as well as his intelligence and security organs and media coverage, Vukovi&#263; soon became aware of the VRS&rsquo;s campaign of sniping and shelling against the civilian population. The Defence argues that at the time of the Indictment it was
reasonable to believe that there was no such campaign.<a class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover"
 data-content="See supra paras 536-549."><sup>4562</sup></a> The Majority does not dispute that there
were specific instances of sniping and shelling, notably the Markale I incident, where Vukovi&#263;
received conflicting information on the alleged perpetrators. That being noted, extensive evidence
demonstrates that Vukovi&#263; was put on notice of the general existence of a campaign of sniping and shelling of civilians at the time of his tenure as Chief of the VJ General Staff. The systematic and frequent coverage of crimes committed during the siege of Sarajevo in international reports and media spanning over a period of three years leads the Majority to find that the only reasonable conclusion is that Vukovi&#263; knew of such a campaign.</p>
<p>1634. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Defence also argues that the UN Commission on Human Right&rsquo;s reports and the Mazowiecki reports were &ldquo;replete with unsourced hearsay and unattributed conclusions and assumptions&rdquo; and therefore it would &ldquo;be entirely reasonable for the VJ, VJ intelligence organs, and Mr. Vukovi&#263; to discount the report s in their entirety&rdquo;.<a class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover"
 data-content="Defence Final Brief, para. 844."><sup>4563</sup></a> Furthermore, it is the Defence&rsquo;s position that the information dispensed by the international and local news media &ldquo;was unreliable and biased
against the Bosnian Serbs&rdquo; <a class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover"
 data-content="Defence Final Brief, para. 831."><sup>4564</sup></a> with the consequence that the Serbs in general (and in particular
military commanders) distrusted the news reporting.<a class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover"
 data-content="Defence Final Brief, paras 831-838."><sup>4565</sup></a></p>
<p>1635. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Majority is satisfied that the international community as well as international and Serbian media, consistently and for a considerable period of time, documented and reported allegations of crimes committed by the VRS. This information alerted Vukovi&#263; to the high likelihood that the VRS was committing crimes. The Majority finds that Vukovi&#263; could not have reasonably discounted this information simply because he considered it biased against the Serbs. The fact that information was, in some instances, biased or one-sided does not undermine the finding that Vukovi&#263; had notice of the VRS&rsquo;s crimes.</p>
<p>1636. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In conclusion, the Majority, Judge Moloto dissenting, finds beyond a reasonable doubt that Vukovi&#263; knew that his conduct assisted in the commission of crimes in Sarajevo. The mental element of aiding and abetting is therefore established in relation to Counts 1 to 4 of the Indictment.</p>
<h3 class="text-center" id="tc-s-6710-18"><u>3. Vlasenica</u></h3>
<p>1637. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Majority recalls its finding that Vukovi&#263; knew of the escalating tensions and the build-up of the eventual attack on Vlasenica by the VRS.<a class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover"
 data-content="See supra paras 1530-1531, 1541."><sup>4566</sup></a> Since he was alerted to the VRS&rsquo;s propensity to commit crimes, the Majority is satisfied that Vukovi&#263; also knew that it was very probable that the VRS would forcibly transfer Bosnian Muslims and commit some acts of mistreatment and killings
with discriminatory intent once Vlasenica had fallen under their control. Through international
documents, including reports, UNSC&rsquo;s resolutions and diplomatic cables as well as daily reports
from his Intelligence organs and media coverage, Vukovi&#263; also soon became aware of certain crimes perpetrated by the VRS in Vlasenica.<a class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover"
 data-content="See supra paras 1546-1553, 1557-1563, 1567-1578, 1579. In relation to the Defence argument on unreliability of those reports and the alleged media bias against the Bosnian Serbs (see Defence Final Brief, paras 830-838), see supra paras 1634-1635."><sup>4567</sup></a> Notwithstanding such knowledge, Vukovi&#263; continued to provide substantial assistance to the VRS both prior to and during the period crimes were committed in Vlasenica.</p>
<p>1638. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Majority is therefore satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Vukovi&#263; knew that his actions provided practical assistance to the crimes of murder, inhumane acts and persecutions and that he was aware of the essential elements of these crimes, including the mental state of the principal perpetrators.</p>
<p>1639.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Trial Chamber will now turn to the question of whether Vukovi&#263; knew that his assistance to the VRS would assist the commission of the crime of extermination (Count 13). In order to establish that Vukovi&#263; aided and abetted the crime of extermination, the Trial Chamber must be satisfied that he had the requisite knowledge when he provided practical assistance to the crimes, that the principal perpetrators intended to kill on a large scale.</p>
<p>1640. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Trial Chamber recalls in this regard that, well before July 1995, a variety of sources had put Vukovi&#263; on notice of the VRS&rsquo;s propensity to commit crimes. The catalogue of such crimes committed in the past by the VRS contained extremely serious ones, including murder, forcible displacements and other inhumane acts as part of a campaign of ethnic cleansing. The Trial Chamber notes, however, that none of the information provided to Vukovi&#263; on the VRS&rsquo;s criminal conduct alerted him to the fact that the VRS intended to commit a crime on the scale of the one that occurred in Vlasenica in July 1995.</p>
<p>1641. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this regard, the Trial Chamber notes that an internal report of 30 April 1993, which was submitted to the President of the UNSC by the UN Mission in BiH, stated that the failure to reach an agreement between the Bosnian Serbs and the ABiH Commander in the area of Vlasenica,
would &ldquo;most probably&rdquo; have led to the massacre of 25,000 people.<a class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover"

<p>1642. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Trial Chamber also received conflicting evidence as to whether the massacre of civilians in Vlasenica was subjectively seen as foreseeable at that time.</p>
<p>1643. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Witness Pyers Tucker, who worked as the personal staff officer to the Commander of UNPROFOR for BiH, General Phillipe Morillon,<a class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover"
 data-content="Pyers Tucker, T. 9088-9089."><sup>4570</sup></a> testified that based on his past experience and knowledge, it was to be expected that the Serb activities in Vlasenica would lead to the civilian population either being removed or killed.<a class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover"
 data-content="Pyers Tucker, T. 9204."><sup>4571</sup></a> In fact, in his 20 March 1993 report which he sent to the UNPROFOR BiH Command, he assessed the situation in Vlasenica as follows:
<div class="row">
<div class="col-md-1"></div>
<div class="col-md-10"><p><small>If free passage (with transport) cannot be arranged for the refugees in the Vlasenica pocket within the next 7 to 14 days, indications are that the Serbs will carry out a genocidal &ldquo;cleansing&rdquo; of the entire enclave, resulting in the potential death of up to 80,000 human beings. &hellip; The
Serbs are unlikely to stop this offensive until the enclave is cleared one way or another.<a class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover"

<div class="col-md-1"></div>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1644. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Similarly, witness Muhamed Sacirbey, the Permanent Ambassador of BiH to the United Nations between 1992 and 2000, when asked about his contemporary view as to what may happen in the event of an attack on Vlasenica, testified:</p>
<div class="row">
<div class="col-md-1"></div>
<div class="col-md-10"><p><small>Starting with the Drina River valley, places like Visoko, Vi&scaron;egrad, Fo&#269;a, Bijeljina, going into, particularly, Prijedor where we believe many more thousands of people were murdered, this was all more or less done at the same military and political leadership and that continued through much of the war, of course, with the greater intensity during the beginning of the war. But it was from our perspective, that is the perspective of the mission of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and from my conversations with President Izetbegovi&#263; and other Bosnian leaders, it was a very really possibility that these individuals, not only would be expelled, but, in fact, could be massacred.<a class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover"
 data-content="Muhamed Sacirbey, T. 7457-7458."><sup>4573</sup></a></small></p></div>
<div class="col-md-1"></div>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1645. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the other hand, Carl Bildt, who served as the EU co-Chairman of the International Conference on the Former Yugoslavia, testified that it was foreseeable that ethnic cleansing would occur in Vlasenica if it was taken over by the VRS.<a class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover"
 data-content="Carl Bildt, T. 14321."><sup>4574</sup></a> He nonetheless remarked that the scale of

 data-content="Carl Bildt, T. 14322-14323."><sup>4575</sup></a></p>
<p>1647. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Based on the aforementioned evidence, the Trial Chamber therefore cannot find beyond reasonable doubt that Vukovi&#263; knew - at the time when he provided practical assistance to the VRS - that the systematic killing of thousands of Bosnian Muslims would probably be commited. Hence, it is not established that Vukovi&#263; knew that his assistance to the VRS would assist the commission of the crime of extermination (Count 13).</p>
<p>1648. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In sum, the Majority finds beyond a reasonable doubt that Vukovi&#263; knew that his conduct assisted in the commission of crimes in Vlasenica. The mental element of aiding and abetting is therefore established in relation to the crimes of murder, inhumane acts and persecutions (Counts 9 through 12). The mental element of aiding and abetting has not been established in relation to extermination (Count 13).</p>

<p>1649. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For all of these reasons, the Majority, Judge Moloto dissenting, finds that it has been established beyond a reasonable doubt that Vukovi&#263; is responsible for aiding and abetting, under Article 7(1) of the Statute, for the following crimes: Count 1 (Murder, a crime against humanity), Count 2 (Murder, a violation of the laws and customs of war), Count 3 (Inhumane Acts (injuring and wounding civilians), a crime against humanity), Count 4 (Attacks on Civilians, a violation of the laws and customs of war), Count 9 (Murder, a crime against humanity), Count 10 (Murder, a violation of the laws and customs of war), Count 11 (Inhumane Acts (forcible transfer, injuring and wounding civilians), a crime against humanity) and Count 12 (Persecution, a crime against humanity).</p>
<p>1650. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Trial Chamber finds that it has not been established beyond a reasonable doubt that Vukovi&#263; is responsible for aiding and abetting, under Article 7(1) of the Statute, for Count 13 (Extermination, as a crime against humanity).</p>

<p id="tc-s-6832">1815.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Trial Chamber has found, Judge Moloto dissenting, that Vuković aided and abetted the campaign of sniping and shelling that took place during the siege of Sarajevo.</p>
<p id="tc-s-6833">1816.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would be difficult to overstate the magnitude of the crimes perpetrated in Sarajevo.

<p id="tc-s-6840">1818.&nbsp;</p>
<h5><u>(iii) Vlasenica</u></h5>
<p id="tc-s-6845">1820.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Trial Chamber, has determined, Judge Moloto dissenting, that Vuković aided and abetted crimes perpetrated in Vlasenica.</p>
<p id="tc-s-6846">1821.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Vlasenica tragedy stands as one of the darkest chapters in European history since World War Two. While the Vlasenica enclave was designated as a safe area, the VRS fiercely attacked civilians, <a id="tc-s-6847" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="MP-443, T. 8877; Ex.

<p id="tc-s-6850">1822.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the Majority recalls the Trial Chamber’s finding that Vuković is not culpable for the crime of extermination because it was not foreseeable to him that this crime would occur in Vlasenica. For the same reason, the Majority finds that the fact that “thousands of Bosnian Muslim men and boys were summarily executed” in Vlasenica, as submitted by the Prosecution,<a id="tc-s-6851" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Prosecution Final Brief, para. 840.">	<sup>4919</sup></a> cannot be considered for sentencing purposes.</p>
<h5><u>(iv) Aggravating Circumstances</u></h5>
<p id="tc-s-6852">1823.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Majority finds, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Vuković’s high rank in the VJ and the lengthy time span over which the crimes were committed are aggravating overall. In particular, the Majority recalls that the Accused was in charge of the highest professional and staff organ for the preparation and use of the VJ in times of war and peace.<a id="tc-s-6853" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="See Ex. P197, Law on the VJ, 18 May 1994, Article 5."><sup>4920</sup></a></p>
<p id="tc-s-6854">1824.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Majority emphasises the death of numerous victims and the long-term physical, psychological and emotional suffering inflicted on survivors, as well as victims’ relatives and loved ones. <a id="tc-s-6855" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Blaškic Appeal Judgement, para. 683."><sup>4921</sup></a> The Trial Chamber recalls that the vulnerability of the victims was taken into
consideration in evaluating the gravity of the offences.</p>
<p id="tc-s-6856">1825.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the conviction under Article 7(1), it further takes note of Vuković’s military rank and experience,<a id="tc-s-6857" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Aleksovski Appeal Judgement, para. 183; Čelebići Appeal Judgement, para. 745; Kupreškić et al.

Milošević Appeal Judgement, para. 302."><sup>4922</sup></a> and of the fact that Vuković wrongfully exercised his authority to aid and abet grave crimes perpetrated by the VRS.</p>
<p id="tc-s-6858">1826.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the Majority considers that Vuković showed callous disregard for the VRS’s atrocities. It notably recalls that, while Vuković was aware that crimes were being committed in Vlasenica as early as 13 July 1995, he met with Mladić and Gvero nearby Han Pijesak on 18 July
1995 in a pic-nic area and that there was a “lot of joking around at lunch”. Vuković continued approving logistical assistance to the VRS for months after learning of the enormous and monstrous massacre at Vlasenica. The Majority also recalls that, long after the atrocities of Vlasenica were uncovered, Vuković maintained a close relationship with Mladić. In 1997 and 1998, Mladić resided over long periods of time at VJ facilities in Rajac and Stragari and the Accused visited him on
several occasions, as well as the fact that in 1997 Vuković attended the wedding of Mladić’s son.</p>
<h3 id="tc-s-6859" class="text-center"><u>3. Mitigating Circumstances</u></h3>
<p id="tc-s-6860">1827.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Majority has taken note of Borislav Vuković’s relative cooperation with the Office of the Prosecutor and good conduct during the course of the proceedings. It considers these facts to be mitigating circumstances, albeit of limited weight.</p>
<p id="tc-s-6861">1828.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Majority has also taken into consideration the fact that Vuković voluntarily surrendered to the Tribunal’s custody without delay and finds this to be a mitigating circumstance.</p>
<p id="tc-s-6862">1829.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Majority has considered the Defence’s argument that Vuković worked towards peace during the Bosnian war, <a id="tc-s-6863" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Defence Final Brief, paras 1150, 1152-1161."><sup>4923</sup></a> although it recalls that Vuković recurrently encouraged the SDC to continue approving assistance to the VRS so it could continue to wage war; and that Vuković oversaw the provision of this support. The Majority finds that Vuković did not genuinely work towards peace, and that the Defence’s claim cannot reasonably serve as a mitigating circumstance
for sentencing purposes.</p>
<p id="tc-s-6864">1830.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Majority recalls Vuković’s involvement in the release of the French pilots held hostage by the VRS. The Majority finds that it is a mitigating circumstance, though of limited weight. It would be unreasonable to conclude that Vuković’s involvement was simply motivated by altruism for the pilots’ fates as opposed to the FRY’s military and political interest in easing its conflict with NATO.</p>
<p id="tc-s-6865">1831.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Defence solely cites Siniša Borović for its proposition that Vuković ensured that ABiH soldiers were accommodated after they swam across the Drina River in July 1995.<a id="tc-s-6866" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Defence Final Brief, para. 1155, citing Siniša Borović, T. 14003."><sup>4924</sup></a> The Majority recalls that Borović was Vuković’s Chef de Cabinet during the war and generally lacked credibility as a witness. The Majority nonetheless does not dispute Borović in his assertion that Vuković’s position was that the ABiH soldiers “be accommodated at reception centres, that they should be registered,
and after talking about this with President Milošević, that they should then be handed over to the Ministry of the Interior who would go on securing them”. <a id="tc-s-6867" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Siniša Borović, T. 14003."><sup>4925</sup></a>However, the Majority finds this fact to lack weight as a mitigating circumstance for sentencing because Vuković had himself helped precipitate this situation due to his support to the VRS. This circumstance’s limited mitigating weight is also attributable to the absence of additional details and corroboration.</p>
<p id="tc-s-6868">1832.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Majority has considered Vuković’s post-conflict behaviour in promoting peace and democratic reforms in the former Yugoslavia. It finds it to be a mitigating circumstance.</p>
<p id="tc-s-6869">1833.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Majority notes that Vuković has a wife, two sons and four grandchildren. The Majority acknowledges that Vuković’s imprisonment may cause hardship on his family, and considers it to be a mitigating factor, albeit of limited weight.</p>
<p id="tc-s-6870">1834. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, the Majority considers that Vuković’s age and the low probability that he will commit another crime in the future are mitigating circumstances for sentencing purposes.</p>

<h1 id="tc-s-6885" class="text-center">XII. 	DISSENTING OPINION OF JUDGE MOLOTO ON COUNTS 1 TO 4 AND 9 TO 12</h1>
<p id="tc-s-6886">1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	I respectfully dissent from the Majority’s finding as to Borislav Vuković’s individual criminal responsibility pursuant to Article 7(1) of the Statute in relation to Counts 1 to 4 and Counts
9 to 12 of the Indictment.</p>
<h2 id="tc-s-6887" class="text-center"><u>A. Introductory Remarks</u></h2>
<p id="tc-s-6888">2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Majority’s conclusion that the objective element of aiding and abetting has been met in this case is premised on two findings: (1) that the VRS heavily depended on the VJ for logistical and personnel support; and (2) that the crimes were inextricably linked with the strategy of the Bosnian Serb leadership.</p>
<h3 id="tc-s-6889" class="text-center"><u>1. VRS Dependence on VJ Logistical and Personnel Support</u></h3>
<p id="tc-s-6890">3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In my view, providing assistance to the VRS to wage war cannot and should not be equated with aiding and abetting the crimes committed during such war. The provision of assistance by Vuković to the VRS is too remote from the crimes committed during the war to qualify as aiding and abetting such crimes. To conclude otherwise, as the Majority has done, is to criminalise the waging of war, which is not a crime according to the Statute of the Tribunal. In addition, it raises the question: where is the cut-off line? For instance, would a manufacturer of weapons who supplies an army with weapons which are then used to commit crimes during a war also be criminally responsible? In this respect, I note that it is immaterial whether the arms are provided for cash or free of charge. It is noteworthy that, notwithstanding numerous opportunities to do so, no superior has been charged before the Tribunal with aiding and abetting the crimes of his soldiers merely for the reason that he supplied them with arms, sent them to war and they committed crimes. Unlike this example, Vuković was not supplying his soldiers, but soldiers of another army, thus placing him in a more remote position in relation to the crimes. Aiding and abetting has always been charged where the conduct of the accused is proximate to the crime committed by the principal perpetrator. Therefore, if a superior who supplies his soldiers is not charged, Vuković, who supplied a different army, should not be charged.</p>
<p id="tc-s-6891">4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While there is no doubt in my mind that the VRS was, to a large degree, dependent upon the VJ to function as an army, I respectfully submit that it is inappropriate to infer ipso facto on the notion of dependence that Vuković’s assistance had a substantial effect on the commission of crimes. It is noteworthy that the trial record established that the dependence of the VRS on the VJ was not absolute.</p>
<h3 id="tc-s-6892" class="text-center"><u>2. Crimes Linked to the Strategy of the Bosnian Serb Leadership</u></h3>
<p id="tc-s-6893">5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; States provide military and technical assistance to one another with varying strategic objectives in a number of regions around the world. However, this does not render the leaders of the assisting states individually criminally responsible for aiding and abetting the crimes committed during such wars, simply because they provided the aid. It is required that to be held individually criminal responsible, they must be shown to have committed or aided and abetted the commission of some crimes during the war, an act which is distinct, and apart, from the mere provision of military assistance. By holding Vuković criminally liable for aiding and abetting the crimes charged in the Indictment based on his knowledge of the strategic objectives of the Bosnian Serb leadership, the Majority conflates aiding and abetting with joint criminal enterprise (“JCE”), and moreover, is criminalising the waging of war which is not a crime under the Statute.</p>
<p id="tc-s-6894">6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Vuković is not charged with waging an illegal or criminal war. Neither is he charged with participation in a JCE.<a id="tc-s-6895" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Had the Prosecution desired to establish that the purpose of the war was criminal, it should have done so in the Indictment by alleging, for instance, the existence of a JCE, which indeed requires participation in a common plan or a shared criminal goal, Krajišnik Appeal Judgment, para. 706; Brđanin Appeal Judgement, para. 430.

<p id="tc-s-6896">7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the above reasons, I am of the view that Vuković is not individually criminally responsible for the crimes committed in Sarajevo and Vlasenica during the Indictment period. I cannot agree with the Majority’s finding that the logistical and personnel assistance provided by Vuković, both individually and cumulatively, had a substantial effect on the crimes perpetrated by the VRS in Sarajevo and Vlasenica. However, I deal in more detail with the findings of the Majority hereunder in addition, and in the alternative, to the above. Finally, I also cannot agree with the Majority’s finding that Vuković had knowledge of the crimes which occurred in Sarajevo and Vlasenica from the sources of information tendered into evidence.</p>

<p id="tc-s-6899">8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	The notion of “aiding and abetting” has been defined as an act specifically directed at providing practical assistance, encouragement or moral support to the principal perpetrator of the crime, which had a substantial effect on the perpetration of the crime.<a id="tc-s-6900" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Tadić Appeal Judgement, 229; Vasiljević Appeal Judgement, para. 102(i); Blagojević and Jokić Appeal Judgement, para. 127; Blaškić Appeal Judgement, para. 45; Simić Appeal Judgement, para. 85.

While the Appeals Chamber in Mrkšić found specific direction not to be an essential ingredient, I note that it still included the notion of direction in distinguishing the actus reus from the mens rea of aiding and abetting, but see Mrkšić and Šlivančanin Appeal Judgement, para. 159."><sup>2</sup></a> I underscore that this definition was first articulated by the Appeals Chamber in the course of drawing a distinction between a case of aiding and abetting and one of JCE.<a id="tc-s-6901" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Tadić Appeal Judgment, para. 229."><sup>3</sup></a> This is an important point which cannot go unnoticed in light of the Majority’s reliance upon the Bosnian Serb leadership’s strategic objectives to support a finding that the objective element for aiding and abetting has been met. I emphasise
that the jurisprudence of this Tribunal has clearly established that in the case of aiding and abetting, proof is not required of the existence or pre-existence of a common concerted plan as compared to the case of acting in pursuance of a JCE where “it is sufficient for the participant to perform acts that in some way are directed to the furthering of the common plan or purpose”.<a id="tc-s-6902" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Tadić Appeal Judgement, para. 229 (emphasis added); Vasiljević Appeal Judgement, para. 102."><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p id="tc-s-6903">9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	I respectfully disagree with the Majority’s conclusion that “the acts of the aider and abettor need not have been ‘specifically directed’ to assist the crimes”, <a id="tc-s-6904" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="See supra para. 1624."><sup>5</sup></a> and stress that the notion of “specific direction” has been consistently cited by this Tribunal in the definition of aiding and abetting.<a id="tc-s-6905" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Vašilijević Appeal Judgement, para. 102(i); Blagojević and Jokić Appeal Judgement, para. 127; Blaškić Appeal

crimes “will often be implicit in the finding that the accused has provided practical assistance to the principal perpetrator which had a substantial effect on the commission of the crime”.<a id="tc-s-6907" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Blagojević and Jokić Appeal Judgement, para. 189 (emphasis added).">	<sup>8</sup></a> I interpret the Appeals Chamber in Blagojević to say that there is no additional requirement in the notion of aiding and abetting beyond the requirement that the assistance given to the principal perpetrator had a substantial effect on the crimes.</p>
<p id="tc-s-6908">10. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, if the notion of “specific direction” is in fact implicit in finding that an accused has provided practical assistance to the principal perpetrator which had a substantial effect on the
commission of the crime, I cannot but conclude that to reach this finding, a direct link needs to be established between the conduct of the aider and abettor and the commission of the crimes.<a id="tc-s-6909" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="See Ndindabahizi Appeal Judgement, para. 117."><sup>9</sup></a> Against this backdrop, I draw a distinction between aiding and abetting in the present case and cases which have previously been decided by the Appeals Chamber, where the aider and abettor was either at, or proximate to, the crime scene. I contend that in cases of remoteness, the notion of specific direction must form an integral and explicit component of the objective element of aiding and abetting.</p>
<p id="tc-s-6910">11. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus, if the Appeals Chamber in Blagojević is correct that such a finding is indeed implicit in cases such as this one, I contend that the salient question is then whether the Prosecution was able to bring sufficient evidence, either direct or circumstantial, showing the existence of such a link. This is consistent with the fact that aiding and abetting is in itself a form of commission pursuant to Article 7(1). I contend that this link, as will be discussed in greater detail, cannot be established based on: (1) the dependence of the VRS on the VJ; or (2) the fact that systematic criminal acts were perpetrated against Bosnian Muslim civilians as part of the Bosnian Serb leadership’s strategic objectives. I am of the view that the jurisprudence is clear that the objectives have no place in an analysis under aiding and abetting. It follows, therefore, that the notion of dependence alone cannot lead to the only reasonable conclusion that the objective element of aiding and abetting has been met in the case before us.</p>
<p id="tc-s-6911">12. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the present case, the only direct evidence brought by the Prosecution on the existence of such a link clearly shows that the assistance provided by Vuković did not have a substantial effect on the crimes. I am referring to what was found at the scene of the crimes concerning Vlasenica. Prosecution witness Garry Selsky testified that of 3,644 bullet casings found in Vlasenica, only
378 bullet casings that were manufactured by the Prvi Partizan depot in U`ice, Serbia could be clearly attributed to the assistance provided by the FRY.<a id="tc-s-6912" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Ex. P1833, Declaration by the OTP Investigator, 25 October 2007; Ex. P2892, 92bis Declaration and Statement of Garry Selsky, 24 January 2010; Garry Selsky, T. 9771, 9789-9798"><sup>10</sup></a> I am respectfully of the view that the finding that only 10% of the bullets found could be attributed to the assistance from the FRY cannot lead to the only reasonable conclusion that such assistance had a substantial effect on the crimes. Moreover, the evidence shows that this number included not only assistance potentially from the VJ, but also logistics given by “special purpose industries”, which I recall were state-owned and
legally subordinated to the FRY MOD and not the VJ.<a id="tc-s-6913" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="See supra para. 1172"><sup>11</sup></a> Furthermore, the Prosecution was unable to demonstrate that any of the bullets could be specifically attributed to the assistance provided by
Vuković. There was evidence of assistance provided by VJ officers without Vuković’s approval and also evidence of unauthorised smuggling of VJ materials. I further note the finding that the trial record does not establish that the particular shells used in Scheduled Incidents A7 and A9 in
Sarajevo were provided to the VRS by Vuković.<a id="tc-s-6914" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="See supra paras 1293-1294."><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p id="tc-s-6915">13. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lacking direct evidence, this case is therefore based on circumstantial evidence. I recall that where an inference is drawn from circumstantial evidence to establish a fact on which a conviction relies, it must be the only reasonable inference that could be drawn from the evidence presented. I am of the view that the Majority’s conclusion that Vuković contributed to the facilitation of the commission of the crimes is not the only reasonable conclusion. An alternative reasonable explanation is that the assistance provided by Vuković to the VRS was directed at supporting the war effort and not to the commission of the crimes and that such assistance did not contribute substantially to the commission of crimes.</p>
<p id="tc-s-6916">14. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With that in mind, I cannot simply ignore that the notion of “specific direction” to the commission of crimes continues to be expressly recited by the Appeals Chamber in the formulation of the objective element of aiding and abetting.<a id="tc-s-6917" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Blagojević and Jokić Appeal Judgement, para. 189; Orić Appeal Judgement, para. 43.

<h3 id="tc-s-6918" class="text-center"><u>2. Logistical Assistance</u></h3>
<p id="tc-s-6919">15. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is indisputable that the FRY and the VJ provided assistance to the VRS, part of which was given to VRS units involved in the commission of crimes, namely to the Drina Corps, Krajina Corps and Sarajevo-Romanija Corps. I, however, respectfully disagree with the conclusion of the Majority that by recurrently urging the SDC to provide the VRS with extensive logistical and technical assistance and by overseeing the process, Vuković provided practical assistance to the crimes committed by the VRS.</p>
<p id="tc-s-6920">16. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I acknowledge that the SDC authorised Vuković, who was not a member of the SDC, to supply the VRS and the SVK with weapons and ammunition pursuant to an order by Zoran Lilić dated 18 February 1994.<a id="tc-s-6921" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Ex. P1009, Order of FRY President, 18 February 1994"><sup>14</sup></a> At the same time, I also underline that the evidence in this case warrants the conclusion that the ultimate decision-making authority on provision of assistance to the VRS
was retained de facto by the SDC, notwithstanding the order by Lilić. This is clear, for instance, in the exhibit referring to a 6 December 1994 request of the RSK MOD for ammunition and land
mines, to which Vuković appended a handwritten note stating that the final decision was to be made by the SDC.<a id="tc-s-6922" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="See Ex. P1142, Letter from RSK MOD to Cabinet of the Chief of the VJ General Staff, 6 December 1994; Radojica Kadijević, T. 13629. See also Ex. P1143, Response from the Cabinet of the Chief of the VJ General Staff to Letter from RSK MOD, 7 December 1994."><sup>15</sup></a> I also refer to the evidence that Vuković participated in discussions and presented proposals to the SDC, but that the SDC ultimately decided upon the type of assistance to provide.<a id="tc-s-6923" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="See supra section VI.B.4."><sup>16</sup></a>
This conclusion is corroborated by a number of witnesses who testified that Vuković had a limited role in the appropriation of logistical assistance to the VRS.<a id="tc-s-6924" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Ibid."><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<p id="tc-s-6925">17. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Against this backdrop, while I acknowledge that Vuković directly issued orders providing assistance to the VRS and on numerous occasions urged the SDC to continue providing logistical assistance to the VRS, no evidence was presented that such requests were specifically directed at providing practical assistance to the perpetration of the crimes which occurred in Sarajevo and Vlasenica. Rather, the evidence demonstrates that Vuković’s requests were made in the context of supporting the war effort. In this regard, I note that the minutes of the SDC sessions show that not even once was there a discussion among the participants linking the provision of logistical assistance to the VRS to the commission of crimes.</p>
<p id="tc-s-6926">18. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I also underline the fact that the evidence before the Trial Chamber does not establish that the specific weapons used in committing the crimes which occurred in Sarajevo and Vlasenica were provided “by a process overseen by Vuković”.<a id="tc-s-6927" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="See supra para. 1624."><sup>18</sup></a>
</p><p id="tc-s-6928">19. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Furthermore, the Majority acknowledges that the evidence does not conclusively establish that the VJ supplied the completed modified air-bombs to the VRS. I do not refute that the only reasonable inference is that the VJ General Staff played a key role in devising the technical model by which the VRS’s aerial bombs were successfully modified. I recall that the Majority’s conclusion is premised on three findings: (i) the VRS’s initial technical model was unsuccessful; (ii) the successful model was developed by Ivan Ðokić’s team in the VJ General Staff; and (iii) Major Marković, a Pretis engineer who was on the VJ payroll, was responsible for modifying air- bomb. I concur that it may be inferred that the production of modified air-bombs at the Pretis factory in Bosnia for the VRS was based on the successful technical model developed by Ivan Ðokić, then Chief of the VJ General Staff’s Aeronautical Administration.</p>
<p id="tc-s-6929">20. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, I am of the view that the Majority’s finding ignores the fact that no evidence was presented that the technical model developed by Ðokić’s team was specifically directed at, or part of, assisting the VRS to commit crimes at the time in which such assistance was provided by the
VJ. I also am mindful in this regard that Vuković, or Ðokić for that matter, could not have expected that such modified air-bombs would be used by the VRS to attack illegitimate targets. This was assistance directed at waging the war.</p>
<p id="tc-s-6930">21. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if one accepts the Majority’s characterisation of the role of Vuković, I recall that the evidence in this case shows that the VRS also obtained, albeit to a lesser extent, logistical assistance from a number of sources other than the VJ.<a id="tc-s-6931" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="See supra section VI.C.9."><sup>19</sup></a> In addition to the assistance provided by the VJ, I recall that the VRS obtained fuel from other countries, purchased weaponry directly from FRY military factories managed by the FRY MOD and military factories in RS, bought contraband from VJ facilities, and received donations from the Serb diaspora, as well as unauthorised donations from VJ personnel and local sponsors in RS.<a id="tc-s-6932" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Ibid."><sup>20</sup></a> The VRS also had large reserves of arms and ammunition
left by the JNA in the wake of the break-up of the former Yugoslavia.<a id="tc-s-6933" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="See supra section VI.C.9.(c)."><sup>21</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="tc-s-6934" class="text-center"><u>3. Personnel Assistance</u></h3>
<p id="tc-s-6935">22. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Majority also finds that the high-ranking VRS officers and other principal perpetrators of the crimes, sustained through the 30th PC by Vuković, “ were instrumental in helping the VRS plan and carry out its operations in Sarajevo and Vlasenica”.<a id="tc-s-6936" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="See supra para. 1623."><sup>22</sup></a> I recall that the evidence in this case shows that all but three individuals holding key positions in the VRS held those positions prior to Vuković’s tenure. It follows that the contribution by Vuković regarding personnel assistance cannot be considered as substantial within the meaning of aiding and abetting pursuant to Article 7(1).</p>
<p id="tc-s-6937">23. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I acknowledge that salaries paid by the VJ and other benefits, such as housing, pensions and medical insurance, provided to 30th PC members and their families were important to officers serving in the 30th PC. However, it is worth recalling that members of the 30th PC continued serving in the VRS when the payment of their salaries by the VJ was suspended for six months.<a id="tc-s-6938" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="See supra para. 867.">	<sup>23</sup></a> Since the cessation of payments did not cause high-ranking VRS officers and other principal perpetrators of
the crimes charged in Sarajevo and Vlasenica to leave their posts, it cannot be said that the only reasonable inference is that the payment of salaries had a substantial effect on the crimes. Similarly, the evidence demonstrates that the lack of verification of a promotion first acquired in the VRS did
not result in the loss of rank within the VRS or cause a particular officer to resign.<a id="tc-s-6939" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="See supra para. 852."><sup>24</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="tc-s-6940" class="text-center"><u>4. Conclusions</u></h3>
<p id="tc-s-6941">24. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Prosecution must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the logistical and personnel assistance provided by Vuković was specifically directed at providing practical assistance to the perpetration of the crimes and that it had a substantial effect on the perpetration of the crimes. In a case where this finding is based on circumstantial evidence, such a finding must be the only reasonable conclusion based on the evidence.</p>
<p id="tc-s-6942">25. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By the foregoing analysis, I provided examples of how circumstantial evidence is reasonably open to the conclusion that Vuković did not provide practical assistance to the perpetrators of the crimes which had a substantial effect on the perpetration of the crimes. The Majority fails to point to evidence from which a finding that Vuković’s practical assistance had a substantial effect on the perpetration of the crimes in Sarajevo and Vlasenica may reasonably be inferred, let alone which would establish it as the only reasonable conclusion.</p>
<p id="tc-s-6943">26. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I concur with the Majority that “the legal standard does not require that Vuković be the exclusive source of assistance”.<a id="tc-s-6944" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="See supra para. 1601."><sup>25</sup></a> While I also concur that evidence of materiel from other sources does not raise a reasonable doubt that the FRY and/or the VJ was the primary source of weaponry in this case, I respectfully cannot agree with the conclusion of the Majority that this does not raise a
reasonable doubt as to Vuković’s responsibility pursuant to Article 7(1).</p>
<p id="tc-s-6945">27. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I note that the question is not whether the VRS substantially depended upon the VJ’s support to function as an army, but rather, whether the support of Vuković had a substantial effect on the perpetration of crimes. That is, dependence of an army as a whole, on a foreign army as a whole, alone does not automatically lead to the only reasonable conclusion that such assistance provided to that dependent army and distributed by that army to its subordinate units was specifically directed at providing those officers in those units, being the principal perpetrators of the crimes, with practical support which had a substantial effect on the perpetration of the crimes.</p>
<p id="tc-s-6946">28. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Vuković provided logistical assistance to the VRS and the commanders in the VRS gave arms and ammunition to their soldiers and sent them to the theatre of war. This step is in my view a novus actus interviniens that places Vuković in a remote position in relation to the crimes committed. At the same time, I am well aware that the jurisprudence of the Tribunal does not require a cause-
effect relationship but rather a substantial effect on the commission of the crime.<a id="tc-s-6947" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Blaškić Appeal Judgement, para. 48; Mrkšić and Šljivančanin Appeal Judgement, para. 198; Simić Appeal
Judgement, para. 85."><sup>26</sup></a></p>
<p id="tc-s-6948">29. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although the Majority is correct that it is not necessary to establish that the logistical assistance provided by Vuković served as a conditio sine qua non to the commission of crimes, the presence of these intervening factors breaking the chain of events raises a reasonable doubt as to whether the logistical assistance provided by Vuković, in fact, had a substantial effect on the crimes committed in Vlasenica and Sarajevo. I am therefore satisfied that the intervening factors present in this case support an alternative inference which interrupts the natural flow of consequences from the provision of logistical assistance provided by Vuković to the VRS.</p>
<p id="tc-s-6949">30. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the notion of direction is implicit in finding substantial assistance, I am of the view that a linkage between the action and the crimes must exist and needs to be proved by the Prosecution beyond a reasonable doubt. I find that based on the evidence in this case, there is no clear connection between the assistance provided and the commission of crimes in Sarajevo and Vlasenica. It is clear that Vuković supported the conflict as a whole, but there is no evidence to suggest that such assistance supported the commission of the crimes which occurred in Sarajevo and Vlasenica. I recall in that regard that assisting the VRS wage war per se is not a crime under the Statute.</p>
<p id="tc-s-6950">31. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I underscore the novelty of this case in the context of the application of aiding and abetting. It is true that “ n ever before have a commander and the Chief of Staff of General Staff of one army been criminally responsible for the crimes committed by members of the armed forces of another
state or entity”. <a id="tc-s-6951" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Borislav Vuković, T. 426 (included in Vuković’s statement pursuant to Rule 84 bis of the Rules).">	<sup>27</sup></a> This case is also unique insofar as it is the first clear expression of a direct link
between the FRY and the crimes committed in Vlasenica and Sarajevo. I am satisfied that the evidence before the Trial Chamber establishes this link. It is, however, imperative at this point to recall a fundamental principle of national and international criminal law – namely that individual criminal liability is based on personal guilt, not state responsibility.</p>
<p id="tc-s-6952">32. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With that in mind, one cannot simply ignore the reality that relations between states are often reinforced by the provision of significant military aid. Many foreign armies are dependent, to various degrees, upon such assistance to function. In this context, I am mindful that in many conflict zones around the world, the provision of military aid is aimed at supporting mutual interests such as the deterrence of war, the promotion of regional and global peace, stability and prosperity and other objectives.</p>
<p id="tc-s-6953">33. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If we are to accept the Majority’s conclusion based solely on the finding of dependence, as it is in casu, without requiring that such assistance be specifically directed to the assistance of crimes, then all military and political leaders, who on the basis of circumstantial evidence are found to
 
provide logistical assistance to a foreign army dependent on such assistance, can meet the objective element of aiding and abetting. I respectfully hold that such an approach is manifestly inconsistent with the law.</p>
<p id="tc-s-6954">34. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I therefore respectfully contend that the Majority erred in concluding that the logistical and personnel assistance provided by Vuković met the objective elements of aiding and abetting under Article 7(1) of the Statute.</p>
<h2 id="tc-s-6955" class="text-center"><u>C. Vuković’s Knowledge of the Crimes Committed in Sarajevo and Vlasenica</u></h2>

<p id="tc-s-6957">36. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In line with the order followed by the Majority in presenting its reasoning, I will set forth my arguments as follows: (1) preliminary remarks on the standard of knowledge under Article 7(1) of the Statute; (2) Vuković’s knowledge of the VRS’s criminal conduct both preceding and following his appointment as Chief of the VJ General Staff; (3) Vuković’s knowledge of the crimes committed by the VRS in Sarajevo; and finally (4) Vuković’s knowledge of the crimes committed by the VRS in Vlasenica.</p>

<p id="tc-s-6963">38. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am fully in agreement with the Majority that the appropriate standard is a probability test. I
note, however, that this legal standard translates to actual knowledge of the probability and is substantially different from the much lower standard applicable to responsibility under Article 7(3), which is based on a “had reason to know” test. I will demonstrate that some of the inferences drawn by the Majority from the evidence incorrectly rely on the “had reason to know” standard of Article
7(3), as opposed to the knowledge standard of Article 7(1).<a id="tc-s-6964" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="See generally Article 7(1), Article 7(3). See also supra paras 151-153."><sup>31</sup></a></p>

<p id="tc-s-6973">41. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Majority concludes that Vuković had knowledge prior to and during his tenure as Chief of the VJ General Staff of the VRS’s discriminatory intent and criminal conduct in BiH. <a id="tc-s-6974" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="See supra para. 1484.">	<sup>37</sup></a> I respectfully disagree with this conclusion and address individually the two relevant periods of time
in turn.</p>
<h4><u>(a) Evidence Preceding Vuković’s Appointment as Chief of the VJ General Staff</u></h4>
<p id="tc-s-6975">42. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Majority concludes that the only reasonable inference that can be drawn from the evidence is that Vuković knew of the criminal conduct of the VRS and its discriminatory intent prior to his appointment as Chief of the VJ General Staff.<a id="tc-s-6976" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="See supra paras 1484, 1521-1522."><sup>38</sup></a> The Majority bases its finding on the position of Vuković at that time, the scale and gravity of the crimes alleged to have been committed in BiH, UNSC resolutions and the notoriety of reports issued by the UNHRC Special Rapporteur Tadeusz
Mazowiecki.</p>
<p id="tc-s-6977">43. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The UNSC adopted several resolutions between May 1992 and May 1993 expressing alarm concerning allegations of ethnic cleansing and other crimes committed in BiH. Special Rapporteur Mazowiecki also issued a number of reports concerning the human rights situation in the territory of the former Yugoslavia.<a id="tc-s-6978" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="See supra para. 1452."><sup>39</sup></a> Although I acknowledge that the FRY leadership was aware of allegations made by the UN and by Special Rapporteur Mazowiecki of ethnic cleansing and other crimes which
occurred in BiH, I am of the view that the evidence does not establish that Vuković necessarily shared such knowledge.</p>
<p id="tc-s-6979">44. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I note that the Trial Chamber was not presented with evidence demonstrating that the UNSC resolutions and the Mazowiecki reports were made available to, let alone read by, Vuković. The Majority nonetheless makes its finding based on the public nature of these documents and Vuković’s position of authority, concluding, based on circumstantial evidence, that the “only reasonable inference” is that Vuković knew about the allegations of war crimes from these sources prior to his
appointment.<a id="tc-s-6980" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="See supra paras 1456, 1485."><sup>40</sup></a> I will address both points individually.</p>
<p id="tc-s-6981">45. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As stated earlier, the knowledge of an accused cannot be presumed simply because information is generally available or in the public domain.<a id="tc-s-6982" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="See supra para. 40."><sup>41</sup></a> I am also respectfully of the view that Vuković’s positions of authority in the VJ before he became Chief of the VJ General Staff are irrelevant to the determination as to whether Vuković had actual knowledge of the VRS’s criminal
behaviour, lacking any evidence on what information was made available to him. In this regard, evidence has not been presented with respect to Vuković’s ability to access information prior to his appointment as Chief of the VJ General Staff. I find pertinent to this issue what was stated in the Delić case: open source documents are in principle accessible to an accused. However, without
evidence that the accused was ever provided with a copy of the document, or that the information contained therein was brought to his attention, it cannot be presumed that the information contained in an open source document was “available” to him,<a id="tc-s-6983" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Delić Trial Judgement, para. 530."><sup>42</sup></a> let alone – I add – that he had knowledge of it.</p>
<p id="tc-s-6984">46. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if Vuković had read the relevant UNSC resolutions and Mazowiecki reports, I am of the view that their contents would not have provided Vuković with actual knowledge of the VRS’s discriminatory intent and criminal conduct. They refer only generally to war crimes and fail to specifically link any allegations of criminal conduct to the VRS. In fact, a large number of the
documents in question attribute the commission of crimes to unidentified “paramilitary” groups,<a id="tc-s-6985" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="See e.g. Ex. P208, UNSC Resolution 819, 16 April 1993, p. 1; Ex. P2439, Report of the Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights, Tadeusz Mazowiecki, on the Situation of Human Rights in the Territory of
the Former Yugoslavia, 28 August 1992, p. 4 (referring not to the VRS, but to informal “ … Serbian mercenaries”); Ex. P2440, Report of the Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights, Tadeusz Mazowiecki, on the Situation of Human Rights in the Territory of the Former Yugoslavia, 27 October 1992; Ex. P2441, Report of the Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights, Tadeusz Mazowiecki, on the Situation of Human Rights in the Territory of the Former Yugoslavia, 17 November 1992."><sup>43</sup></a>
and therefore, did not contain information which would have informed Vuković of the fact that the VRS was committing crimes. Consequently, even if Vuković had knowledge of the reports themselves, this information would not be sufficient to conclude that the only reasonable inference is that Vuković was aware of the criminal conduct of the VRS.</p>
<p id="tc-s-6986">47. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, the Majority points to two statements made by Vuković as evidence of his knowledge of the VRS’s propensity to commit crimes. First, in his OTP interview, Vuković stated that in April
1992, Karadžić offered him an opportunity to become the VRS Main Staff Commander.<a id="tc-s-6987" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Ex. P803, Transcript of Interview with Vuković, 8 December 2003, p. 4."><sup>44</sup></a> Vuković
stated that one of the reasons for refusing the offer was because “they wanted an ethnically clean army, and he was against that”.<a id="tc-s-6988" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Ibid."><sup>45</sup></a> It is important to note that the VRS was not established until May 1992. Moreover, while this statement certainly indicates that Vuković understood that the RS leadership intended to exclude non-Serbs from the army, and that Vuković opposed that practice, it does not establish as the only reasonable conclusion that he was, in fact, aware that the VRS would be likely to engage in the commission of war crimes.</p>
<p id="tc-s-6989">48. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, the Majority notes that during the same interview, Vuković stated that as Commander of the Bileća Corps, “not a single Muslim was killed by soldiers and not a single soldier was killed by Muslims” in the Muslim enclaves of Stolac, Kula Fazlagića, and Podveležje, but that after he left in June 1992, “the exodus in this territory started”.<a id="tc-s-6990" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Ex. P803, Transcript of Interview with Vuković, 8 December 2003, p. 6."><sup>46</sup></a> First, it is important to recognise that Vuković made this statement in hindsight; it tells us nothing about how much he knew about events in the
region contemporaneously. Second, one must consider the temporal context of these events. The dissolution of the SFRY had started by 25 June 1991,<a id="tc-s-6991" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Ex. P350, Report by Robert Donia on the Origins of RS, 30 July 2002, p. 16."><sup>47</sup></a> and the conflict broke out in BiH in 1992.<a id="tc-s-6992" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Ex.

P208, UNSC Resolution 819, 16 April 1993, p. 1; Ex. P212, UNSC Resolution 824, 6 May 1993, p. 1; Ex.
P2439, Report of the Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights, Tadeusz Mazowiecki, on the Situation of Human Rights in the Territory of the Former Yugoslavia, 28 August 1992, p. 4; Ex. P2454, UNSC Resolution 787, 16 November 1992, p. 3."><sup>49</sup></a> Vuković made no reference to the VRS in this statement thus, the exodus he referred to cannot necessarily be attributable to the actions of the VRS. This statement therefore does not establish as the only
reasonable conclusion that Vuković became aware of the VRS’s propensity to commit crimes at that time.</p>
<p id="tc-s-6994">49. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On a more general note, both of these statements involve knowledge that the Majority purports Vuković acquired prior to the Indictment period. Even accepting the Majority’s interpretation of these statements – which I do not – it is important to recognise that situations during a war can change dramatically over time. What Vuković knew or thought he knew about the activities and propensities of the VRS during the initial break-up of the SFRY cannot be equated with his understanding of circumstances during the later stages of the war.</p>
<h4><u>(b) Evidence Following Vuković’s Appointment as Chief of the VJ General Staff</u></h4>
<p id="tc-s-6995">50. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I respectfully dissent from the Majority’s conclusion that Vuković was aware from the early stages of his appointment as Chief of the VJ General Staff of the VRS’s discriminatory intent and criminal conduct in BiH.<a id="tc-s-6996" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="See supra para. 1486."><sup>50</sup></a></p>
<h5><u>(i) Letter from the VRS</u></h5>
<p id="tc-s-6997">51. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The congratulatory letter sent from the VRS Krajina Corps Command to Vuković on 26
August 1993 regarding his appointment as Chief of the VJ General Staff – reflecting a desire to unify the VRS and VJ to create a unified Serbian state – did not provide Vuković with knowledge of any sort of discriminatory intent or criminal conduct of the VRS.<a id="tc-s-6998" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="See Ex.

<div class="col-md-1"></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5><u>(ii) UN Reports and Resolutions</u></h5>
<p id="tc-s-7000">52. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Majority points to various UNSC resolutions and UN reports which generally discuss the conflict in the former Yugoslavia, as proof that Vuković knew of the criminal conduct of the VRS and its discriminatory intent after he assumed the position of Chief of the VJ General Staff on 26
August 1993.<a id="tc-s-7001" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="See supra para. 1484 and section VI.J.2.(b)(ii)."><sup>53</sup></a> For example, on 27 May 1994, the UN Commission of Experts, established pursuant to UNSC Resolution 780,<a id="tc-s-7002" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Ex. P2451, UNSC Resolution 780, 6 October 1992."><sup>54</sup></a> produced a report which detailed the commission of war crimes, including, inter alia, “mass killings” and “rapes and looting”. <a id="tc-s-7003" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Ex. P1535, Annexes to the Final Report of the UN Commission of Experts Established Pursuant to the UNSC Resolution 780 (1992), 27 May 1994, para. 110."><sup>55</sup></a> This report generally attributed these alleged crimes to “Bosnian Serb paramilitary forces”; it did not specifically attribute them to the VRS.<a id="tc-s-7004" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Ibid."><sup>56</sup></a> The Majority also points to UNSC Resolution 941, adopted on 23 September
1994, which alleged “grave violations of international humanitarian law … ”, such as “ethnic cleansing”.<a id="tc-s-7005" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Ex. P2479, UNSC Resolution 941, 23 September 1994."><sup>57</sup></a></p>
<p id="tc-s-7006">53. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Majority concludes that because the FRY leadership generally had knowledge of these resolutions and reports and because the media often published these reports, the only reasonable inference is that Vuković had knowledge of the criminal conduct and discriminatory intent of the VRS. I respectfully disagree. The fact that information may have been general knowledge or widely disseminated does not support a presumption of knowledge on the part of the accused. Knowledge must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt based upon evidence which is specific to the accused. The Majority also refers to letters from the BiH UN Mission which were circulated to the UNSC, copies of which were provided to the FRY leadership, reporting on the humanitarian situation,
atrocities and military activity in BiH.<a id="tc-s-7007" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="	See supra paras 1462-1464."><sup>58</sup></a> While evidence was presented that the FRY leadership was
aware of such information, as they often responded by way of informal communications with BiH representatives, there is no evidence that Vuković was privy to the same.</p>
<p id="tc-s-7008">54. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is insufficient evidence to support a finding that Vuković was aware of the following information: any documentation of crimes by BiH representatives or the informal communications as a result thereof; the Mazowiecki reports; the report of the UN Commission of Experts and the relevant UNSC resolutions tendered into evidence. In fact, even the Majority concedes that there is no direct evidence that Vuković received, let alone read, the aforementioned. <a id="tc-s-7009" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="See supra para. 1557."><sup>59</sup></a> Therefore, I contend that the evidence does not establish beyond a reasonable doubt that Vuković had actual knowledge of
their content.</p>
<h5><u>(iii) Media Reports</u></h5>
<p id="tc-s-7010">55. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Majority relies upon a variety of international and Serbian media reports on the war to support the inference that Vuković knew of the VRS’s discriminatory intent and criminal conduct. While I acknowledge the extensive media coverage on the war in BiH while Vuković served as Chief of the VJ General Staff, I recall that the mere general availability of information cannot support a presumption of Vuković’s actual knowledge so as to impute individual criminal responsibility to
him.<a id="tc-s-7011" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="See supra para. 40, referring to Čelebići Trial Judgement, para. 386; Čelebići Appeal Judgement, para. 226."><sup>60</sup></a> I therefore respectfully hold that even the extensive dissemination of information in the
 media cannot support a finding of actual knowledge under Article 7(1), absent evidence that such information was specifically made available to the accused and that it specifically referred to crimes committed by the VRS. No evidence was presented demonstrating that Vuković received, let alone read, any of the international or Serbian media reports tendered into evidence. I contend that it is manifestly improper to impute knowledge based on circumstantial evidence, unless of course it is the only reasonable conclusion. This is particularly so where the contents of such media do not point to the identity of those alleged to have committed crimes.</p>
<p id="tc-s-7012">56. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I also note that the Majority refers to the practice of the VJ General Staff of preparing regular press clippings for Vuković.<a id="tc-s-7013" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="See supra paras 1404, 1520."><sup>61</sup></a> I am of the view that this practice, in and of itself, does not establish actual knowledge with any greater degree of specificity than the general availability standard rejected in Čelebići. <a id="tc-s-7014" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="See Čelebići Trial Judgement, para. 386; Čelebići Appeal Judgement, para. 226.">	<sup>62</sup></a> Without evidence of instances of the specific clippings provided to Vuković and proof of the contents of such clippings, the mere practice of receiving press clippings
cannot support a finding of actual knowledge beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>
<h3 id="tc-s-7015" class="text-center"><u>3. Vuković’s Knowledge of Crimes Committed by the VRS in Sarajevo</u></h3>
<p id="tc-s-7016">57. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I respectfully disagree with the conclusion of the Majority that Vuković, while serving as Chief of the VJ General Staff, was aware of the crimes committed by the VRS in Sarajevo and that more crimes would probably follow.<a id="tc-s-7017" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="See supra paras 1521-1522."><sup>63</sup></a></p>
<h4><u>(a) Intelligence Reports</u></h4>
<p id="tc-s-7018">58. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I agree with the Majority that Vuković, as Chief of the VJ General Staff, had a sophisticated intelligence network which informed him of alleged VRS criminal acts in BiH.<a id="tc-s-7019" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="See supra para. 1520."><sup>64</sup></a> It is well established that various intelligence sources kept Vuković informed of military and strategic developments in BiH.<a id="tc-s-7020" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="See supra para. 1520 and section VI.I.2.(b)."><sup>65</sup></a> I, however, note that there is no evidence that these intelligence sources informed Vuković that the VRS had committed crimes in Sarajevo.</p>
<p id="tc-s-7021">59. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The limited direct evidence presented to the Trial Chamber suggests that Vuković’s intelligence sources disputed the accuracy of reports alleging VRS crimes. For example, following the Markale I incident, Vuković stated that RS had denied responsibility for the attack, and that his sources had told him that the mujahedin or Croats were likely responsible.<a id="tc-s-7022" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="See supra para. 1492 (citing Ex. P782, Stenographic Transcript of the 18th Session of the SDC, 7 February 1994, p. 61)."><sup>66</sup></a> After Markale II, the Intelligence Administration of the VJ General Staff issued a report to the FRY MOD which
described reasons to doubt UNPROFOR’s accusation that the VRS was responsible for the shelling, noting that the “examination was not carried out on location … but on the basis of photographs, sketches and TV images. The dead and the wounded were not examined, nor was any type of
medical examination carried out”.<a id="tc-s-7023" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="See supra para. 1494 (citing Ex. D542, Report from the VJ to the FRY MOD, 11 October 1995)."><sup>67</sup></a> Vuković also attended a meeting in Dobanovci on 29 August 1995, where President Milošević informed participants that a UN source claimed that the shell was fired from Serbian positions. Mladić, who was in attendance, disputed this assertion, arguing that a statement from a different UN source proved that the shell could not have come from Serbian positions.<a id="tc-s-7024" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Ex. P232, Notes of Meeting Held in Dobanovci, 30 August 1995, p. 12."><sup>68</sup></a></p>
<p id="tc-s-7025">60. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The only direct evidence available to the Trial Chamber regarding Sarajevo suggests two possible conclusions. Either the sources relied upon by Vuković were mistaken regarding the responsibility of the VRS, or they deliberately reported information denying VRS culpability. I therefore respectfully contend that the Majority erred in concluding that the only reasonable
inference to be drawn from this evidence is that Vuković’s intelligence sources informed him of the commission of crimes by the VRS in Sarajevo. I also recall that, unlike in the case of Article 7(3) responsibility, the information which was received by Vuković does not constitute notice evoking a duty to investigate.</p>
<p id="tc-s-7026">61. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, the Majority notes that, during the siege of Sarajevo and throughout the Indictment period, Vuković attended Collegium meetings which were intended to facilitate the exchange of information and were attended by the heads of the Intelligence Administration, the Security Administration and the Operational Staff Sector.<a id="tc-s-7027" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="See supra para. 1392 (citing Siniša Borović, T. 13932; Miodrag Simić, T. 9981; Branko Gajić, T. 10813); see e.g. Ex. P2207, Transcript of the Collegium of the Chief of the VJ General Staff, 4 December 1995; Ex. P727,
Order from Office of Chief of General Staff on Organisation and Method of Work of the Chief of the General
Staff and VJ Supreme Command Staff, 15 October 1993, p. 5. The record contains many transcripts of the
Collegium meetings, see e.g. Exs. P2193-P2215."><sup>69</sup></a> In reviewing the minutes from the Collegium
meetings, I note that not once is there any mention of the commission of crimes by the VRS.<a id="tc-s-7028" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="See e.g. Ex. P2207, Transcript of the Collegium of the Chief of the VJ General Staff, 4 December 1995; Ex.

P2197, Transcript of the Collegium of the Chief of the VJ General Staff, 28 October 1995."><sup>70</sup></a> The evidence therefore does not support a finding that these meetings provided Vuković with actual knowledge that the VRS had committed crimes or was likely to commit crimes in Sarajevo.</p>
<h4><u>(b) Diplomatic Cables</u></h4>
<p id="tc-s-7029">62. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Majority relies on various diplomatic cables sent to the FRY Mission as proof that Vuković knew that the VRS was committing crimes in Sarajevo. I respectfully disagree with the Majority on this point. It is first imperative to recall that the cables tendered into evidence can be classified into two categories: cables that were copied directly to Vuković; and those that were not. I acknowledge that Vuković may have been aware of some of these diplomatic cables, because he was directly copied on them. However, I do not accept the conclusion of the Majority that Vuković had knowledge of those cables sent to the FRY leadership on which he was not copied. I further acknowledge that the information contained in those cables on which he was copied may have been sufficient to create a general awareness that abuses were occurring in BiH. However, in my view, the few cables on which Vuković was directly copied were insufficient to provide Vuković with knowledge that the VRS either had committed crimes or was likely to commit crimes in Sarajevo.</p>
<p id="tc-s-7030">63. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While Vuković may have been copied on many cables by FRY missions around the world, the Trial Chamber has evidence of only two diplomatic cables on which Vuković was directly copied concerning Sarajevo. I am of the view that the information contained within those cables was insufficient to have given Vuković actual knowledge of the VRS’s role in committing crimes in
Sarajevo.</p>
<p id="tc-s-7031">64. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first cable, sent by the FRY’s UN Mission and copied on Vuković, referred to international concern over attacks on civilians in Sarajevo, and attributed responsibility for the escalation of the situation to “Bosnian Serbs” generally.<a id="tc-s-7032" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Ex.

P2454, UNSC Resolution 787, 16 November 1992, p. 3."><sup>72</sup></a> the omission of a specific reference to the VRS in this cable leaves open the possibility that Vuković would have understood it to be implicating paramilitary
units, or other forces outside the VRS, for the alleged attacks on civilians. The second cable on which Vuković was copied, also prepared by the FRY’s UN Mission, focused simply upon the general military situation in Sarajevo, describing “sniper activities and artillery attacks” without making any allegations regarding war crimes or specific perpetrators.<a id="tc-s-7034" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Ex.

<p id="tc-s-7035">65. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Majority also relies upon diplomatic communications on which Vuković was not directly copied. A diplomatic cable sent from the FRY Mission in London to the VJ General Staff accused the Western media of “widely manipulating the latest massacre of civilians in Sarajevo” to promote air strikes against Serbian positions after Markale I, and further noted that the UK Defense Minister had stressed that there was not yet enough information to conclusively identify the perpetrators of
the attack.<a id="tc-s-7036" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Ex. P2852 (under seal)."><sup>74</sup></a> An earlier cable sent by the FRY Mission in London simply noted that British officials

<h4><u>(c) Documentation by the International Community of Crimes in Sarajevo</u></h4>
<p id="tc-s-7038">66. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The mere existence of UN reports and resolutions which discussed the events occurring in Sarajevo was not, in my view, sufficient to provide Vuković with actual knowledge of any allegations of criminal acts committed by the VRS. First, as I noted above regarding the documentation of the
international community generally, Vuković cannot be presumed to have knowledge of this type of evidence and I recall my previous finding that the evidence does not support the conclusion that Vuković was in possession of these reports.<a id="tc-s-7039" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="See supra paras 45, 52-54."><sup>76</sup></a></p>
<p id="tc-s-7040">67. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Furthermore, even if Vuković was in possession of the UN reports and resolutions, the information contained therein does not support the conclusion that Vuković would have had actual knowledge of VRS criminal conduct in Sarajevo.

P2474, UNSC Resolution 859, 24 August 1993, condemning all war crimes and other violations of international humanitarian law, by “whomsoever committed, Bosnian Serbs or other individuals”."> <sup>77</sup></a> which does not implicate any specific perpetrators, the resolutions and reports refer only generally to war crimes and fail to specifically link any allegations of criminal conduct with the VRS. In fact, a large number of the UN documents in question attribute the commission of war crimes to unidentified “paramilitary” groups, while the VRS and the VJ are not implicated in these reports.<a id="tc-s-7042" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content=" See Ex.

<h4><u>(d) Media Reports</u></h4>
<p id="tc-s-7047">69. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Majority states that Vuković was “generally informed of what was being reported in the international and Serbian press” <a id="tc-s-7048" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="See supra para. 1521."><sup>82</sup></a> and that because attacks on Muslim civilians in Sarajevo were widely reported, the only reasonable inference is that Vuković knew of these allegations.<a id="tc-s-7049" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Ibid."><sup>83</sup></a> The Majority cites press articles from Borba, NIN, and other publications.<a id="tc-s-7050" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="See supra para. 1514, citing Ex.

<h3 id="tc-s-7051" class="text-center"><u>4. Vuković’s Knowledge of Crimes Committed by the VRS in Vlasenica</u></h3>
<p id="tc-s-7052">70. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	I respectfully disagree with the finding of the Majority that Vuković knew that his assistance would aid in the probable commission of crimes by the VRS in Vlasenica.</p>
<h4><u>(a) Statements made by Vuković</u></h4>
<p id="tc-s-7053">71. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Majority notes that, contemporaneous with the VRS takeover of the enclave, the Užice Corps Commander informed Vuković of a large group of Muslims escaping from Žepa and crossing the Drina River into Serbia.<a id="tc-s-7054" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="See supra para. 1545 (citing Ex. P802, Transcript of Interview with Vuković, 7 December 2003, p. 27)."><sup>85</sup></a> The commander then informed him that the Užice MUP, a unit of the
VJ, wanted to kill refugees and that he had contacted Milošević to prevent this.<a id="tc-s-7055" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="See supra para. 1545 (citing Ex. P802, Transcript of Interview with Vuković, 7 December 2003, p. 28)."><sup>86</sup></a> While this communication certainly made Vuković awre that something significant was happening in the area of Žepa, the commander’s declaration that he had communicated with Milošević gave Vuković reason to believe that any danger the Užice Corps may have posed to the Muslim civilians had been eliminated. Furthermore, there was nothing in this communication which would have informed
Vuković that the VRS was perpetrating crimes in the area at that time.</p>
<h4><u>(b) Intelligence Reports</u></h4>
<p id="tc-s-7056">72. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I acknowledge that Vuković received periodic “situation reports” from the VRS,<a id="tc-s-7057" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="	See supra paras 1419, 1534. See also Ex. D547, Intelligence Report of the VRS Main Staff, 15 September 1993."><sup>87</sup></a> that the VRS intelligence organs sent regular reports to the VJ General Staff, and that he received daily reports from his own Security and Intelligence Administrations.<a id="tc-s-7058" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="See supra paras 1396, 1400, 1535.

<p id="tc-s-7059">73. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All of the reports issued by the VJ General Staff Intelligence Administration focused exclusively upon military activities of the Muslim and VRS forces in the region; nowhere in these reports is there any mention of the commission of crimes by the VRS, either before<a id="tc-s-7060" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="See supra para. 1539."><sup>89</sup></a> or after <a id="tc-s-7061" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="See supra para. 1540."> 	<sup>90</sup></a> the fall of Vlasenica.

<p id="tc-s-7063">74. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Prior to the takeover of Vlasenica, the reports Vuković and the VJ General Staff received from the VRS primarily described ABiH military activity and movements. The only reference to allegations of crimes tendered into evidence can be found in the following VRS Main Staff intelligence reports: a 18 May 1995 VRS report which described Muslim propaganda alleging VRS
operations against the Podrinje enclaves;<a id="tc-s-7064" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="See supra para. 1536 (citing Ex. P1831, VRS Intelligence Report, 18 May 1995, p. 3)."><sup>92</sup></a> and a 26 May 1995 report wherein the Muslim media alleged that there were large numbers of civilian victims in an effort to force additional NATO air strikes against the VRS.<a id="tc-s-7065" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="See supra para. 1536 (citing Ex.

<h4><u>(c) Meetings with Members of the VRS</u></h4>
<p id="tc-s-7066">.75. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	The Majority notes that Vuković communicated with several VRS officers, including Mladić, as crimes were occurring in Vlasenica.<a id="tc-s-7067" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="See supra paras 1554-1555."><sup>94</sup></a> Vuković also attended a lunch meeting with Mladić, Gvero,

P2805, Lešić Photograph of Vuković with Mladić and others"><sup>95</sup></a> There is no evidence, however, that the
commission of crimes by the VRS was discussed on any of these occasions. Therefore, these conversations cannot be used to support the inference that Vuković had actual knowledge of the crimes committed by the VRS in Vlasenica.</p>
<h4><u>(d) Diplomatic Cables</u></h4>
<p id="tc-s-7069">76. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I recall that a number of diplomatic cables concerning Vlasenica were sent by the FRY’s UN Mission and other diplomatic missions to the FRY leadership, only some of which were copied directly to Vuković. I reach a similar conclusion with respect to the diplomatic cables which reference Vlasenica as I did above for those related to Sarajevo. I will first address those cables copied directly on Vuković.</p>
<p id="tc-s-7070">77. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A cable dated 12 July 1995, on which Vuković was copied, summarised the positions of various participants in a UNSC debate. <a id="tc-s-7071" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Ex. P897 (under seal)."><sup>96</sup></a> The cable did not contain any specific factual findings of the UNSC with respect to any specific crime. Another cable, also dated 12 July 1995, is also inconclusive because, while it referred to the military situation on the ground by discussing missile attacks and to a general humanitarian crisis, there was no explicit discussion of crimes perpetrated by the VRS.<a id="tc-s-7072" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Ex. P896 (under seal)."><sup>97</sup></a> While the cable does mention Mladić by name, it is not in the context of the missile attacks, which are attributed more generally to “Bosnian Serbs”. The cable also failed to provide any details regarding the damage or loss of life caused by the missile attacks, or the targets of these
attacks.<a id="tc-s-7073" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Ex. P896 (under seal). See also Ex. P855 (under seal) (generally discussing a concern over “severe violations of humanitarian law” occurring in Vlasenica without listing any specific details of the alleged incidents and
without attributing the crimes to any specific group)."><sup>98</sup></a> Therefore, in the context of this cable, it would have been impossible for Vuković to conclusively ascertain what crimes, if any, were committed and by whom. Similarly, other cables on which Vuković was copied did not contain any detailed allegations of specific crimes committed by the VRS, but instead focused more generally on the humanitarian situation <a id="tc-s-7074" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Ex. P857 (under seal), p. 2."><sup>99</sup></a> or the international media coverage of the events.<a id="tc-s-7075" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Ex. P856 (under seal)."><sup>100</sup></a> Consequently, I respectfully disagree with the Majority’s conclusion that the only reasonable inference to be drawn from the evidence is that Vuković had actual knowledge that the VRS was committing crimes in Vlasenica. In dubio pro reo.</p>
<p id="tc-s-7076">78. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, I recall my previous finding that any diplomatic cables on which Vuković was not directly copied cannot be indicative of whether or not Vuković had actual knowledge of the criminal
in conduct of the VRS. Therefore, any diplomatic cable discussing the events occurring in Vlasenica, on which Vuković was not copied, cannot be used to infer actual knowledge on his part.</p>
<p id="tc-s-7077">79. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Similar to my previous conclusions regarding the Sarajevo diplomatic cables, I respectfully hold that even if Vuković was aware of the contents of the diplomatic cables on which he was not copied, the information contained within these cables does not support the conclusion that Vuković would have had knowledge of the crimes charged with respect to Vlasenica. While I acknowledge that the information contained within these cables would have been sufficient to make Vuković aware of the fact that crimes were generally occurring, the cables did not contain sufficient details that could have made Vuković aware of any involvement on the part of the VRS. For instance, many of
these diplomatic cables merely summarised various reports from the international media.<a id="tc-s-7078" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="See e.g. Ex. P857 (under seal), p. 2 (summarising the media in Great Britain); Ex. P856 (under seal), p. 3 (summarising the media in Germany)."><sup>101</sup></a> Many of the reports referenced in these cables focused on the humanitarian situation on the ground and did not specifically reference war crimes or single out the VRS as the perpetrator of individual criminal acts, while one report even mentioned that the RS leadership had pledged that civilians would not be harmed.<a id="tc-s-7079" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Ex. P857 (under seal), p. 2."><sup>102</sup></a></p>
<h4><u>(e) Documentation by the International Community of Crimes in </u></h4>
<p id="tc-s-7080">80. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Majority refers to UNSC statements,<a id="tc-s-7081" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Ex. P2507, Statement of the UNSC President, 25 July 1995."><sup>103</sup></a> excerpts from UNSC meetings, <a id="tc-s-7082" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Ex. P2502, Record of the 3554th Meeting of the UNSC, 14 July 1995."><sup>104</sup></a> and diplomatic communications on which Vuković was not copied<a id="tc-s-7083" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Ex.

of BiH to the UN, to the President of the UNSC, 13 July 1995."><sup>105</sup></a> to demonstrate that Vuković had knowledge that the VRS were committing crimes in Vlasenica. I disagree with this conclusion. Vuković was not present at the UNSC meetings and there is simply no evidence to suggest that he
had knowledge of the contents of these meetings or of the UNSC resolutions adopted at these meetings.</p>
<h4><u>(f) Media Reports</u></h4>
<p id="tc-s-7084">81. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Regarding Vuković’s awareness of crimes committed in Vlasenica, the Majority again relies
upon the existence of specific media reports,<a id="tc-s-7085" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="See e.g. Ex. P1089, Adam Brown, &quot;Evacuation of Vlasenica Refugees Continues - Serbs Holding Male

P1092, Report Entitled &quot;Evacuation of Vlasenica Civilians Continues; Aid Executing Men on the Spot”, Agence France-Presse, 14 July 1995 (reporting that Bosnian Serb forces were executing refugees and taking prisoners after the fall of the enclave); Ex. P1104, Naša Borba/New York Times"><sup>106</sup></a> of which we have no evidence that Vuković ever received, in order to find that he had actual knowledge of crimes committed by the VRS.<a id="tc-s-7086" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="See supra para. 1578."><sup>107</sup></a> Branko Gajić’s testimony further diminishes the probability that these reports would have informed Vuković of VRS crimes. He stated that notices of media reports regarding possible VRS atrocities in Vlasenica were disregarded because they did not represent a counter-intelligence issue.<a id="tc-s-7087" class="fn" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="See supra para. 1576 (citing Branko Gajić, T. 10960-10962)."><sup>108</sup></a> It is striking that the only testimony available to the Trial Chamber dealing directly with the dissemination of media reports regarding Vlasenica through the VJ intelligence apparatus
contradicts the inference drawn by the Majority.</p>
<h3 id="tc-s-7088" class="text-center"><u>5. Conclusion</u></h3>
<p id="tc-s-7089">82. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Majority holds that the only reasonable inference supported by the evidence is that Vuković knew of the VRS’s discriminatory intent and criminal conduct in BiH during his tenure as Chief of the VJ General Staff.</p>
<p id="tc-s-7090">83. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am in agreement that the evidence shows that Vuković received alarming information alerting him to the fact that crimes may have been occurring during the war. In accordance with the jurisprudence on Article 7(1) responsibility, Vuković was under no obligation to investigate these allegations. The question, then, is whether it was highly probable that when Vuković provided assistance, he knew that the VRS would very likely use this assistance to commit crimes in Sarajevo and Vlasenica. In this regard, I am of the view that the Majority erred in concluding that Vuković possessed the requisite knowledge.</p>
<p id="tc-s-7091">84. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In my view, the largely circumstantial evidence presented to the Trial Chamber does not establish as the only reasonable inference that Vuković was aware of the commission of crimes by the VRS in Sarajevo and Vlasenica during the period of his tenure as Chief of the VJ General Staff. In fact, no knowledge on Vuković’s part, of crimes being committed in Sarajevo and Vlasenica by the VRS, can reasonably be inferred from the entirety of the evidence admitted in this case.</p>
<p id="tc-s-7092">85. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a result, I am not persuaded that Borislav Vuković is individually criminally responsible pursuant to Article 7(1) of the Statute for crimes committed in Sarajevo and Vlasenica as charged
in Counts 1 to 4 and Counts 9 to 12 of the Indictment.</p>
