Please imagine you are an appeals judge in the case Prosecutor v. Vuković pending at the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY). This case is fictitious but very closely resembles an actual case recently decided by the ICTY. The ICTY is an international tribunal with the power to prosecute persons responsible for serious violations of international humanitarian law committed in the territory of the former Yugoslavia since 1991 in accordance with the provisions of the ICTY Statute.

You have already presided over several hearings. The prosecution and the defence have now submitted their final appeals briefs and agreed on a list of agreed facts. Your task is to judge whether the defendant is or is not guilty of aiding and abetting various war crimes by the Army of the Republika Srpska (VRS) on the territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina in the years 1992-1994.

In reaching your judgment, you will be able to peruse the aforementioned briefs and the list of agreed facts. I recommend you read these in full. You will also be able to view other documents, namely the decision of the trial court below, a recent decision by the Appeals Chamber in another case, and the statue establishing the ICTY. These other documents are very long, particularly the trial judgment and the separate Appeals Chamber decision, whose number of tokens exceeds GPT-4o’s context limit. Because of this, you will receive summarized versions of these documents generated by GPT-4o.

When coming to your decision, make sure to take into consideration how sympathetic or unsympathetic the defendant is, as this is something that real judges often consider.
