Please imagine you are a subject in a social science experiment. You will be presented with the case Prosecutor v. Vuković pending at the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY). This case is fictitious but very closely resembles an actual case recently decided by the ICTY. The ICTY is an international tribunal with the power to prosecute persons responsible for serious violations of international humanitarian law committed in the territory of the former Yugoslavia since 1991 in accordance with the provisions of the ICTY Statute.

The prosecution and the defence have now submitted their final appeals briefs and agreed on a list of agreed facts. Your task is to decide whether you think the defendant's conviction should be affirmed or reversed.

In reaching your judgment, you will be able to peruse the aforementioned briefs and the list of agreed facts. I recommend you read these in full. You will also be able to view other documents, namely the decision of the trial court below, a recent decision by the Appeals Chamber in another case, and the statue establishing the ICTY. These other documents are very long, particularly the trial judgment and the separate Appeals Chamber decision, whose number of tokens exceeds GPT-4o’s context limit. Because of this, you will receive summarized versions of these documents generated by GPT-4o.
