            present Statute, shall be individually responsible for the

The official position of any accused person, whether as
            Head of State or Government or as a responsible Government
            official, shall not relieve such person of criminal
            responsibility nor mitigate punishment.- 
The fact that any of the acts referred to in articles 2
            to 5 of the present Statute was committed by a subordinate

            take the necessary and reasonable measures to prevent such

The fact that an accused person acted pursuant to an
            order of a Government or of a superior shall not relieve him

            violations of international humanitarian law committed in the
            territory of the former Yugoslavia since 1 January 1991.- 
The International Tribunal shall have primacy over
            national courts. At any stage of the procedure, the
            International Tribunal may formally request national courts
            to defer to the competence of the International Tribunal in
            accordance with the present Statute and the Rules of
            Procedure and Evidence of the International Tribunal.

Article 10 Non-bis-in-idem
-

            constituting serious violations of international humanitarian
            law under the present Statute, for which he or she has
            already been tried by the International Tribunal.- 
A person who has been tried by a national court for acts
            constituting serious violations of international humanitarian
            law may be subsequently tried by the International Tribunal
            only if:
- 
the act for which he or she was tried was
                    characterized as an ordinary crime; or- 
the national court proceedings were not impartial or
                    independent, were designed to shield the accused from
                    international criminal responsibility, or the case was
                    not diligently prosecuted.- 
In considering the penalty to be imposed on a person
            convicted of a crime under the present Statute, the
            International Tribunal shall take into account the extent to
            which any penalty imposed by a national court on the same
            person for the same act has already been served.

Article 11 Organization of the
            International Tribunal

        organs:
